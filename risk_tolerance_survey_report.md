Enhanced Risk Tolerance Survey Design for Investor
Profiling
1. Critique of the Current Risk Tolerance Questionnaire
The existing set of questions (q2–q15 above) mixes demographic/profile queries with
risk attitude queries, and some are redundant or misleading. Key observations:
● Demographic vs. Risk Tolerance Questions: Questions about age (q2),
education (q3), income (q4), and total assets (q5) do not measure risk tolerance
directly – they capture risk capacity or profile information [1] [2]. For example,
age and wealth affect how much risk one can afford (capacity) but not
necessarily willingness to take risk. Best practice is to separate risk capacity
from psychological risk tolerance, rather than average them into one score [3] [4].
Including these in a risk tolerance score can skew results, as noted by CFA
Institute: time horizon, age, liquidity, etc. should be measured independently and
not averaged with risk attitude [3].
● Redundant Risk Attitude Questions: Several questions aim to gauge risk
appetite but overlap:
● q6 (labeled “Yatırım tecrübesi” i.e. investment experience) is misnamed – its
options actually describe risk attitudes (from “never want any loss” to “willing to
risk large loss for high return”). This is misleading, combining experience with
tolerance. It overlaps with q9 , which directly asks how the investor self-identifies
(safe, balanced, or aggressive). Both attempt to classify risk tolerance in broad
terms. Such direct self-assessment can be helpful but may introduce
subjectivity and social desirability bias – clients might choose what they think
is “right” rather than their true comfort, especially if phrasing suggests a “correct”
answer [5] [6].
● q10 (slider for “what % of your portfolio should be in risky assets”) essentially
asks the investor to tell us their risk profile outcome. This can be seen as a
contradiction – the questionnaire is supposed to determine the appropriate risk
allocation, yet this question has the user state it directly. It risks anchoring the
client to an allocation without assessing if it fits their true risk tolerance. It’s also a
complex question for many investors (who may not know how to choose that
percentage). Notably, asking a percentage allocation can bias the answer if the
client has heard rules of thumb (e.g. “100 minus age in equities”) [5]. In fact,
literature flags questions that directly pose allocation percentages as problematic
because they may cue a “desired” response rather than reveal true
preferences [5] [6].
● Recommendation: Use a consistent psychometric approach instead of
multiple overlapping self-classifications. One well-formulated question about risk
attitude (like q9) could suffice; others should be reformulated or dropped to avoid

repetition. Direct allocation questions (like q10) are better derived from the
overall score rather than explicitly asked.
● Behavioral Scenario Questions: q7 (“Your investments lose 20% in a year,
what do you do?”) is a solid hypothetical scenario to gauge behavior under
stress. The options (sell immediately = risk-averse, do nothing = moderate, buy
more = risk-seeking) align with common risk tolerance interpretations [7]. This
question directly measures loss tolerance and composure – literature confirms
that asking how one reacted or would react to losses is useful in profiling [7]. One
caveat: as a forward-looking question, it asks respondents to predict behavior,
which some research notes people struggle with accurately [8]. Nonetheless, it’s
a practical proxy for risk tolerance if we interpret it cautiously.
● The scenario format (and similarly q13–q15) is engaging and can yield more
realistic insights. According to Fintechtime, moving beyond bland checkboxes to
story-based questions can capture a client’s true risk profile better, as traditional
forms often fail to reflect the person [9] [10]. Gamified or narrative scenarios help
clients visualize decisions and respond more authentically, rather than just ticking
“medium” for everything.
● q13–q15 are meant to be dynamic scenarios (“Market Volatility”, “Unexpected
Cash Need”, “Investment Opportunity”), each offering three choices
(low/medium/high risk approaches). These can be very effective in measuring
different dimensions of risk attitude if well-tailored. However, their quality
depends on implementation – they shouldn’t lead the client to an answer. For
instance, options must be neutrally framed (no wording that biases toward what
“experts” or others would do) [11]. Done right, scenario questions add depth by
testing responses to concrete situations (market dip, liquidity crunch, hot
opportunity), which correspond to volatility tolerance , liquidity preference , and
greed vs. fear respectively.
● Knowledge/Experience Questions: q11 (interest in riskier instruments like
crypto, IPOs, NFTs, derivatives) and q12 (which instruments you know or have
used) address the client’s knowledge and experience. These are important for
regulatory compliance (suitability/appropriateness requirements under MiFID II
and SPK regulations) but they are not measures of risk tolerance per se.
● q11 (interest in risky assets) could indicate risk appetite at first glance – if
someone is interested in crypto or derivatives, they might be more risk-tolerant.
But it could also simply reflect curiosity or familiarity. It risks overlap with q12 ,
which asks what they actually have experience with. If a client checks “interested
in crypto” but in q12 says “no experience with crypto,” it more likely highlights a
knowledge gap than risk tolerance.
● It’s better to treat these as separate dimensions : knowledge/experience informs
what products the client can understand (and thus what can be offered) [1] , while
risk tolerance questions determine how much volatility and loss the client can
emotionally withstand. Combining them in one “risk score” can be misleading.

● Recommendation: Retain knowledge and experience questions but don’t score
them as risk tolerance. Instead, use them to ensure any portfolio
recommendation is suitable (e.g. if the client has no knowledge of derivatives,
you’d avoid those products regardless of risk score). Regulators like ESMA
explicitly require assessing knowledge & experience, financial situation
(ability to bear loss), and risk tolerance as distinct inputs in suitability
tests [12].
In summary, the current questionnaire contains valuable elements (scenario-based
questions, clear risk-attitude identifiers) but also flaws : some questions don’t measure
risk tolerance, some duplicate each other, and others may bias or directly “give away”
the profile. Global best practices suggest using a psychometrically valid set of
questions focusing on risk attitudes, while separately noting capacity factors, rather
than mixing everything into one score [3] [4]. The redesign will address these issues by:
(a) clearly separating profile info and risk preference questions, (b) removing or
rephrasing misleading items, and (c) aligning with both behavioral finance insights and
regulatory standards.

2. New Questionnaire Design Requirements and Rationale
Below we propose a set of new risk profiling questions (around 18 in total). They are
grouped by category, with each question grounded in literature and practice. For each
question, we explain its purpose, any regulatory or scientific basis, how it reflects
behavioral finance concepts, and its proposed weight in the risk score (with
justification).

Section A – Investor Profile and Capacity Questions (Captured for
context/regulatory needs; not directly scoring risk tolerance , but used to
flag constraints):
Q1. Age Range: “What is your age group? (a) <30, (b) 31–50, (c) 51–65, (d) >65.”

Rationale/Scientific Basis: Age is often used as a proxy for time horizon and risk
capacity. Younger investors generally have more years to recover from losses, allowing
higher equity exposure, whereas older investors nearing retirement have less capacity
for volatility [13] [14]. This aligns with life-cycle investing theory and the common rule
“reduce risk as you age” [13]. However, age itself is not a determinant of willingness to
take risk – it’s an objective factor.
Regulatory Basis: Both SPK’s suitability test and MiFID II expect firms to consider the
client’s age and investment horizon in determining appropriate investments [1] [12].
Including age ensures compliance by acknowledging this factor.
Behavioral Aspect: Age can correlate with certain behavioral biases (e.g. younger
investors may be overconfident or prone to trend-chasing, older investors may exhibit
more loss aversion due to proximity of goals). While the question doesn’t directly
measure a bias, it situationally flags that a 65+ client might panic more in a downturn
due to shorter horizon (behavioral finance finds that context – e.g., retirees relying on
funds – affects risk perception).
Weight in Scoring: Not directly scored into the risk tolerance number. Instead, age
will moderate the recommended risk level. For instance, even if a 70-year-old shows
high risk tolerance in attitude, the final portfolio risk will be capped more conservatively
because of capacity (short horizon). Conversely, a 25-year-old with moderate risk
attitude might still be placed in a growth portfolio due to long horizon. In the algorithm,
age acts as a constraint or adjustment rather than a raw score component [3] [4].
Q2. Investment Time Horizon: “When do you expect to need to withdraw a significant
portion of your investments? (a) Less than 1 year, (b) 1–3 years, (c) 4–10 years, (d) >
years.”

Literature Basis: Time horizon is a key input in portfolio design. Longer horizons
typically allow taking on more risk (more equity) since interim volatility can be waited
out [13] [15]. This question directly addresses risk need relative to goals – if the goal is
far away, the need (and capacity) for risk is higher, whereas a short-term goal
necessitates capital preservation.
Regulatory Basis: MiFID II and SPK require understanding a client’s investment
objectives and timeline as part of suitability [12]. This question captures those objectives
indirectly by timeframe. Many suitability questionnaires globally include a version of this.
For example, the CFA Institute guide notes goal horizon is crucial and should be
assessed independently in the risk profile [16] [17].
Behavioral Finance: Longer horizons can reduce myopic loss aversion – investors
who don’t need money soon can mentally compartmentalize short-term losses as less
painful. However, some individuals with long horizons still panic (low risk composure ),
which other questions will uncover. This question helps identify if an ostensibly
risk-tolerant young client actually has a short horizon (e.g. saving for a house in 2
years), which would contradict a high-risk strategy. It prevents a framing mismatch
where a client might answer risk questions assuming a long-term frame when in reality
their goal is near-term.
Weight in Scoring: Not directly scored into the tolerance metric, but used as a
modifier. A very short horizon (a) might automatically push the client toward a
conservative overall recommendation, regardless of attitude, because even a
risk-seeking person can’t afford volatility if funds are needed next year. Conversely, a
long horizon (d) allows the client’s risk tolerance score to be fully applied.
Algorithm-wise, we might reduce the final risk score or category if horizon is short (for
example, if horizon <1 year, cap risk level to “Conservative” by policy). Thus, this acts
as a gating factor for risk capacity [17] [4].
Q3. Financial Net Worth / Asset Base: “What is the approximate total value of your
investable financial assets? (a) < ₺100,000, (b) ₺100,000 – 500,000, (c) ₺500,000 –
1,000,000, (d) > ₺1,000,000.”
Scientific Basis: The larger one’s asset base, the higher their risk capacity – a
wealthy investor can absorb a loss (even a large percentage drop) without jeopardizing
their lifestyle or goals [2] [18]. Academic definitions of risk capacity emphasize the ability
to sustain losses without a material change in living standard [2] [18]. This question
approximates that. It’s akin to “ability to bear losses” in MiFID terms.
Regulatory Basis: SPK’s rules and MiFID II both insist on assessing the client’s
financial situation and ability to bear loss [12]. In practice, many suitability forms ask for
net worth or liquid assets for this reason. This question addresses that requirement
directly.

Behavioral Aspect: Wealthier clients sometimes exhibit overconfidence (e.g.,
assuming their success in wealth accumulation translates to investment skill). On the
other hand, less wealthy clients may exhibit loss aversion more strongly because any
loss has a bigger impact on their security. While net worth is factual, it provides context
to interpret the behavioral answers – e.g., a high-risk attitude answer from a
low-net-worth client should be viewed with caution (could be misjudged bravado or
desperation).
Weight in Scoring: No direct points to risk tolerance, but acts as a risk capacity
filter. If a client is in the lowest wealth bracket (a), the advisor would tread carefully
even if their attitude is aggressive – small losses hurt them more. High net worth (d)
doesn’t automatically mean high tolerance, but it means losses are financially
manageable; thus the final recommendation can fully reflect their attitude. We will
incorporate this by possibly giving a slight upward or downward adjustment to the risk
score range or by requiring a manual check : e.g., if a client chooses very risky answers
but has very low capacity, advisor might override the pure score (this follows the
principle that recommended risk should not exceed the lesser of willingness or
ability [19] [18] ).
Q4. Income Stability and Source: “What is your annual income and how stable is it?
(a) Below ₺250,000, not very stable, (b) Below ₺250,000, stable, (c) ₺250k–₺500k
stable, (d) >₺500k stable.” (Note: This combines income level with stability; could be
split if needed.)
- Literature Basis: Income (especially disposable income) influences risk capacity
as well. A high or steady income can replenish losses over time (high capacity),
whereas someone with low or uncertain income can’t easily recover from
investment losses. This ties into the concept of human capital – younger investors
with stable future earning power can effectively take more investment risk
because their future income plays the role of a bond-like stream.
- Regulation: Part of assessing financial situation is understanding income and its
reliability (to judge ability to handle losses or need for liquidity). While not always
explicitly asked in every risk survey, it’s often captured in KYC forms. Including it
helps meet the thoroughness expected by regulators (SPK’s guidelines mention
profession and income as factors in suitability tests [1] ).
- Behavioral Finance: Stable income can buffer an investor’s psychological comfort
with taking risk – they know they have a safety net. If income is unstable, an
investor might panic more during portfolio losses (because there’s no guarantee
of other funds). This question thus also hints at liquidity preference ; an unstable
income earner might need more readily available, safer assets as a cushion.
- Weight: Not directly scored , but considered qualitatively. For instance, if income is
very unstable, the algorithm may recommend keeping a larger emergency fund (outside
the portfolio) or lean the portfolio safer than the raw risk tolerance score indicates. High
stable income, conversely, can support a slightly higher allocation to risky assets if the
client’s risk tolerance allows. In scoring terms, one might assign a small weight (say
5-10%) to income in a composite risk capacity score, but primarily use it for advisor
judgment rather than automated scoring.
Q5. Emergency Fund/Liquidity Needs: “Do you have an emergency fund (cash or
equivalents) to cover unforeseen expenses (e.g. 6 months of expenses)? (a) No, I’d
likely need to liquidate investments in an emergency, (b) Yes, I have some cash but it
might not cover everything, (c) Yes, I have a sufficient emergency fund separate from
investments.”

Basis: This question addresses liquidity risk tolerance. If a client has no emergency
fund, they are effectively less able to tolerate investment risk because any urgent need
forces selling investments (potentially at a loss). In behavioral terms, someone with no
cash buffer will view portfolio volatility with more anxiety , as that money could be
needed suddenly. This relates to mental accounting and self-control – ideally,
investors segregate a safety net (mental account for emergencies) from long-term
investments [16] [17]. If they haven’t, they mentally treat the portfolio as dual-purpose,
meaning they can’t afford much downside.
Regulation: Not explicitly mandated, but it falls under understanding financial
circumstances. A similar concept is captured in questions like “how much of your net
worth is invested” or “could you afford to lose X% without your lifestyle being affected?”
Such questions appear in some risk profile tools to gauge capacity. Our formulation is
user-friendly (“do you have an emergency fund?”) which is easier for clients to relate to.
Weight: This would be qualitative. If answer (a) “no fund, must liquidate” is chosen, it’s
a red flag – the advisor might classify the client as low risk capacity regardless of
attitude, because any loss could be realized at the wrong time. So, this could act as a
hard constraint (e.g., the final risk category should be no higher than “Moderate” if no
emergency fund). If (c) is chosen, it gives comfort that the client’s long-term investments
can ride through volatility. We do not add this to the numerical risk tolerance score, but
we could assign an internal flag or a small adjustment. For instance, answer (a) might
subtract a few points from the final risk score to err on caution, whereas (c) might leave
it unchanged or even add a tiny buffer if needed.
Justification: The above profile questions ensure we gather all the “Know-Your-Client”
essential data (age, wealth, income, liquidity) recommended by regulators and
literature [12] [1]. Importantly, none of these will directly tell us the client’s psychological
comfort with risk – instead, they inform the risk capacity and constraints. We will use
them in the scoring algorithm (Section 3) as modifiers rather than core determinants,
consistent with best practice that objective factors and subjective risk tolerance should
be assessed separately [3] [4].
Section B – Risk Tolerance and Preference Questions (Psychometric
measures of willingness to take risk, loss aversion, etc., contributing
heavily to the risk score ):
Q6. Loss Aversion Scenario: “Imagine you have an investment of ₺100,000. There is
a bad year and its value drops to ₺80,000 (–20%). How would you react? a) Sell all or
part of the investment to prevent further loss. b) Hold on patiently, expecting it will
recover. c) Invest more now since prices are lower (buy the dip).”

Literature Basis: This question directly measures risk tolerance and composure
under loss. It’s very similar to the original q7, which we keep due to strong validity.
Academic and industry questionnaires often include a version of this because it reveals
whether the person is loss-averse (choosing to sell signals low tolerance) or
risk-tolerant (willing to hold or add) [7]. Grable & Lytton’s risk scale, for example, has an
item about response to a 20% loss with similar options and scoring [7]. - Behavioral
Finance: This scenario taps into Prospect Theory and loss aversion. According to
prospect theory, most people strongly dislike losses – often “the pain of losing is about
twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining” [20]. A loss-averse investor will choose
option (a) to avoid further losses (even if it means locking in a sure loss – reflecting the
classic finding that in loss frames, many become risk-seeking to avoid the loss, but
extremely loss-averse individuals just want out). An investor who chooses (c) is
contrarian and likely less loss-averse, possibly even risk-seeking in the loss domain –
comfortable doubling down. Option (b) is a middle-ground indicating some tolerance.
This question’s framing is carefully calibrated: it presents a loss scenario in a
straightforward way to see if the respondent will exhibit the typical aversion or not. We
avoid any language that frames it as “an opportunity” or “a disaster,” which could bias
the decision (framing effect). We simply state the drop and ask the action, ensuring
minimal framing bias [21]. - Regulatory/Best Practice: While not “mandated” by
regulation, assessing how a client handles losses is implicitly required to gauge suitable
risk. ESMA’s guidance implies firms should understand a client’s risk tolerance including
the ability to bear losses emotionally (not just financially) [12]. This question is a direct
way to get that emotional risk tolerance. It’s also essentially the same scenario used in
Turkey’s BES (pension system) 8-question risk quiz and many bank risk profile forms,
indicating its broad acceptance. - Scoring/Weight: High weight (significant
contributor to score). This is one of the core questions for risk tolerance. We
assign, say, 15% of the total score importance to this single item because of its strong
indicative power. Scoring example: option (a) = 0 points (very conservative), (b) = mid
points (e.g. 50), (c) = high points (e.g. 100). Empirical justification: Research shows past
behavior under loss or stated reactions correlate with risk-taking personality [7]. In the
CFA guide, selling in a downturn is labeled “Low Risk Composure,” holding = medium,
investing more = “High Risk Composure” [7]. We mirror that. By awarding substantially
more points to (c) than (b), and to (b) over (a), the algorithm captures a wide separation

someone choosing (c) clearly has a high risk appetite and should get a high risk score
from this question. Someone choosing (a) will be anchored toward a low risk score
overall. This differential weighting is scientifically grounded in the notion that behavior
in loss scenarios is a crucial differentiator in risk profiles [22].
Q7. Risk-Return Trade-off Preference: “Which statement best describes your
investing approach? a) I prefer guaranteed modest returns over any chance of loss –
preserving capital is my priority. b) I seek a balance: some risk for moderate returns, but
nothing extreme. c) I’m opportunity-driven – I’m willing to take substantial risks for the
possibility of high returns.”
Basis: This question is a direct self-assessment of risk preference , similar to the
original q9 but phrased to ensure clarity and distinctiveness of options. It aligns with the
classic risk categories: conservative (capital preservation), balanced, aggressive (high
risk/high return). Many risk tolerance questionnaires include at least one such
self-classification, and studies show it often aligns with the computed score (a good
consistency check) [23]. We include it because it allows the client to explicitly express
their risk mindset in their own perception. - Behavioral Aspect: We must be cautious of
anchoring and social desirability here. By phrasing each option neutrally (none is
labeled “best”), we minimize bias. The framing effect is mitigated by presenting both risk
and return trade-offs in each choice (so the client weighs both, not just one
side) [24] [21]. For example, option (a) says “modest returns” vs “any chance of loss,”
highlighting both aspects. Option (c) explicitly states “substantial risks” vs “high returns,”
so it’s clear. This dual framing avoids luring the client with only the positive or only the
negative of each choice. - Regulatory: Not specifically required, but this kind of
question demonstrates that we asked the client about their risk appetite in plain terms ,
which is good practice. If ever a dispute arises, having the client’s own statement of
approach helps show we knew their tolerance. - Scoring/Weight: High weight. This
will form a sizable part of the score (perhaps ~10-15%). Option (a) would score lowest
(e.g. 20/100), (b) moderate (60/100), (c) highest (100/100). The reason not 0 for (a) is
that even the most conservative investor usually can take some minimal risk (and we
may reserve 0 for truly zero-risk tolerance which might be indicated by multiple
answers). But essentially, this question anchors the subjective risk willingness.
Literature (e.g., CFA Institute’s guidelines) suggests that a question appearing to
professionals as clearly assessing willingness has face validity [25]. This one does – it
passes the face validity test by directly addressing willingness to take risk for return. We
weight it heavily because it’s straightforward and captures the essence of risk tolerance
in the client’s own judgment. If there’s a divergence between this answer and others
(say they claim to be “balanced” here but answer all other questions in a highly
aggressive way), that inconsistency itself is informative and would be flagged during
review rather than blindly averaged.
Q8. Hypothetical Investment Choice (Gain vs. Risk): “If you had to choose an
investment for the next 5 years, which would you prefer? a) An investment likely to
return 4% per year with minimal risk of loss. b) An investment with ~50% chance to
return 20% in a year but ~50% chance to return 0% (no loss of principal). c) An
investment with ~30% chance to gain 50% but ~30% chance to lose 15% (and ~40%
chance to land in between).”

Literature Basis: This question offers a choice dilemma to gauge risk appetite in a
quantitative way. It’s inspired by prospect theory experiments and questionnaires
where participants choose between safe vs. risky prospects. Option (a) is essentially a
low-risk, low-return bond-like option (almost risk-free). Option (b) is a moderate gamble
(no loss expected, but variable high or low return). Option (c) includes a possible loss,
which really tests tolerance. This format is common in risk quizzes (e.g., asking would
you take a 50/50 gamble or a sure thing). However, we extend it to three options to
differentiate moderate vs high risk preferences.
Behavioral Finance: We’re explicitly probing how the client weighs certain small
gains vs. uncertain larger gains and the introduction of possible loss. According to
prospect theory, many people are risk-averse in gains (preferring the sure 4% over a
gamble for more) [26]. Those who pick (b) or (c) demonstrate lower risk aversion or
higher optimism. Option (c) introduces a potential loss, invoking loss aversion directly:
choosing (c) means the client is willing to risk a loss for a big upside, indicating low loss
aversion (or high risk tolerance). Choosing (a) indicates a strong preference for
certainty – classic risk aversion. By including (b) which has no loss of principal, we also
capture those who are okay with uncertainty but not loss – a moderate stance. -
Question Framing: We took care to present probabilities and outcomes clearly, in plain
language, to avoid confusing the client. We avoid saying “50% chance of gain or 50%
chance of nothing” in a complex way; instead we approximate scenarios. We also avoid
technical jargon like “standard deviation” or “volatility”. The percentages give a tangible
sense. We acknowledge that real markets aren’t coin flips, but this is a simplified gauge
of their comfort with uncertainty and loss. We also label time horizon (5 years) to
ensure they frame it as a mid-term investment, not intra-day trading. - Weight:
Moderate weight (~10%). This question adds nuance to the risk profile. Scoring: (a)
would score very low (maybe 0-10 points) as it reflects near zero tolerance for risk; (b)
medium (maybe ~50 points); (c) high (90+ points). We weigh it moderately because, as
research suggests, responses to hypothetical gambles can sometimes diverge from real
behavior – some clients might not fully grasp the probabilities or may answer
aspirationally. Also, as the CFA research cautions, questions with precise probabilities
(“50/50 outcome”) might not always predict real-world risk behavior because real
investments don’t have known odds [27]. We use it as one data point among many. Its
value is in detecting extremes : if someone cannot even tolerate the idea of variable
returns (chooses only the guaranteed return), that cements a conservative profile.
Conversely, if someone willingly chooses a scenario with possible losses for high gain,
that cements aggressive tendency. Thus, it meaningfully impacts the score, but we
cross-check it against other answers rather than overweight it.
Q9. Investing Experience & Confidence: “Which best describes your investing
experience and confidence level? a) I have little to no investment experience and prefer
to rely on professional guidance. b) I have some experience investing in common
assets (stocks, funds, etc.) and feel fairly comfortable making basic decisions. c) I have
extensive investment experience (including volatile markets) and trust my own judgment
fully in investment decisions.”

Basis: This question blends knowledge with self-assessed confidence , which is a
proxy for overconfidence bias. It’s important to gauge not just what products they
know (covered in Q12 later) but how confident they are in managing investments. An
investor with extensive experience who trusts their judgment might take risks due to
overconfidence – studies (Barber & Odean 2001) found that overconfident investors
trade more and take more risk, often to their detriment [28]. We want to identify those
who might have that bias. Conversely, someone with no experience likely should be
more cautious not because of tolerance but due to lack of knowledge – however if they
also express confidence despite no experience, that’s a red flag of overconfidence. -
Behavioral Finance: Overconfidence is measured here. Option (c) essentially flags a
potentially overconfident investor (especially if their actual knowledge is limited).
Overconfidence can lead to underestimating risks and taking on too-aggressive
portfolios or not diversifying [29] [28]. If a client chooses (c) and also, say, selects risky
options elsewhere, the advisor might be dealing with someone who thinks they can
handle more risk than they truly can (or who might chafe at conservative advice). Option
(a) indicates low confidence – such clients might actually panic despite any risk
tolerance because they lack conviction in their decisions. - Regulatory: Experience is
required info. Confidence per se is not required, but asking it indirectly helps ensure the
client’s stated risk tolerance is taken in context. For instance, MiFID II expects firms to
match complexity of products to client experience – a highly confident but novice client
should not be sold complex products without caution [1]. This question, combined with
the factual Q12, helps satisfy that. - Weight: Low-to-moderate weight (maybe ~5%).
This is more of a qualitative modifier. If someone is (c) extensive experience, it might
slightly boost the risk score or simply support their other answers. If (a) no experience, it
might slightly dampen the effective risk-taking recommendation (even if they answered
boldly on other questions, lack of experience means they might not truly understand the
risks they’re endorsing – regulators would urge caution here). We might give a small
point bump for (c) and a small reduction for (a). But we must be careful: confidence
doesn’t equal true tolerance. This question mainly alerts the advisor to potential
misalignment. Thus, its weight in the automated score is minimal, but it will be noted in
the profile summary for human review.
Q10. Reaction to Gains vs Losses: “Psychologically, which affects you more when
investing? a) I celebrate gains, but even small losses bother me a lot (losses loom
larger than gains). b) I’m equally affected by gains and losses – I like gains and dislike
losses in balance. c) I focus on the long term – short-term losses don’t faze me much if I
expect long-term gains.”

Basis: This question attempts to directly ask about loss aversion in a reflective way.
It draws on the concept from prospect theory that for many people, losses are felt more
intensely than equivalent gains [20]. If someone indicates that even small losses upset
them greatly (option a), they are highly loss-averse. Option (c) indicates a low level of
loss aversion and a long-term perspective (which often correlates with higher risk
tolerance). While people’s introspective answers may not be perfect, this provides
insight into their mindset about volatility. - Behavioral Finance: Loss aversion is
explicitly referenced (“losses loom larger than gains” in option a – a phrase directly from
prospect theory research). We are basically asking if the client agrees with that
sentiment or not. Option (c) also hints at long-term framing – a person who naturally
thinks in long-term terms is less prone to the myopic loss aversion phenomenon
(where checking your portfolio too often makes losses hurt more). This is an important
behavioral trait: those who can tolerate seeing temporary losses without panic tend to
be better suited for higher equity portfolios [30] [31]. We included an option (b) for those
in-between (they feel losses and gains in a normal way). - Scoring: Moderate weight
(~10%). This question adds color especially in differentiating the middle. It might be
somewhat correlated with Q6’s scenario, but it’s more psychological. Scoring could be:
(a) = very low (if losses bother them a lot, they likely can’t handle volatility, so perhaps
10 points), (b) = medium (~50 points), (c) = high (~90 points). We weight it because loss
aversion is a key determinant of suitable risk level – even if someone says they want
high returns, if we know losses upset them disproportionately, an aggressive portfolio
could lead to regret and capitulation at the worst time. This is supported by behavioral
finance – loss-averse investors often sell low in panic [8]. Therefore, a strong indication
of loss aversion (option a) will significantly pull the overall risk score down.
Q11. Portfolio Volatility Tolerance: “If your portfolio value fluctuated by 15% up or
down in a typical year, how would you feel? a) Very anxious – I would worry a lot with
that much volatility. b) A bit concerned, but I could tolerate it if long-term growth is likely.
c) Comfortable – I understand this is normal and wouldn’t be alarmed.”
Basis: This question explicitly gauges tolerance for volatility (standard deviation of
returns). It complements the loss scenario question by talking about typical ups and
downs rather than an extreme drop. It’s adapted from questions common in risk profiling
tools that ask about comfort with volatility or range of returns. For example, some
questionnaires ask “how would you feel if your $100k portfolio fell to $85k then rose to
$115k in a year?” – here we simplify to a ±15% notion. - Behavioral: This is about
emotional response to volatility. Option (a) indicates high sensitivity to volatility (likely
would check portfolios often and feel stress). Option (c) indicates composure – aligning
with what CFA’s framework calls risk composure or emotional stability during market
swings [32]. Notably, an investor could be loss-averse (hates permanent losses) but still
understand volatility (temporary swings) – however, usually if short-term swings cause
anxiety, that person is effectively more conservative. This question captures the
emotional side of risk tolerance. - Weight: Moderate (~10%). It overlaps with the
loss aversion question but is still distinct. We might score (a) low (e.g. 20), (b) moderate
(50), (c) high (80). It’s weighted because a person’s stated anxiety about volatility is a
strong indicator of what kind of portfolio they’ll stick with. Research by FinaMetrica and
others shows that risk tolerance questionnaires that include such self-reported anxiety
correlate with investors’ subsequent behavior in volatile markets [33] [34]. Essentially, if
someone says they’d be “very anxious” with 15% swings, giving them a portfolio that
routinely swings that much could lead to them abandoning the plan, which is exactly
what we want to avoid.
Q12. Reaction to a Hypothetical Big Gain: “Suppose one of your investments jumps
+40% in a short time. What are you most likely to do? a) Sell it and lock in the gain –
you can’t lose money by taking profit. b) Keep it but rebalance later – maintain your
strategy and don’t get greedy. c) Buy more or let it ride – big gains could mean it’s a
winner worth investing more in.”

Basis: This question flips the script to how they handle gains. While risk tolerance is
mostly about downside, upside behavior is telling too. Someone who immediately sells
winners (option a) may actually be relatively risk-averse or following mental
accounting (treating the gain as house money to cash out). Someone who lets winners
run or doubles down (option c) is showing a high risk appetite (and possibly
overconfidence or greed bias). Option (b) is a disciplined approach indicating
moderate risk tolerance. Literature in behavioral finance describes the disposition
effect : many investors tend to sell winners too early and hold losers too long, often due
to loss aversion and regret avoidance. Option (a) corresponds to that effect (fear of the
gain turning into a loss, so they lock it in). Option (c) might indicate overconfidence or
trend-chasing. We want to identify these tendencies. - Behavioral Finance: This
question touches on mental accounting and overconfidence. An investor choosing
(a) might be mentally segregating that profit (“I’ve won, now I’ll not risk it”) – classic
mental accounting where they treat gains differently (perhaps as a separate account to
protect) [35]. Option (c) might reflect overconfidence (“it went up because I/my pick is
great, so I expect more”) or simply a high risk appetite to maximize gains. It also can
reflect gambling mentality if extreme. This gives a fuller picture of the client’s behavior
under positive outcomes, complementing the loss questions. - Weight: Low to
moderate (~5-10%). Gains behavior is informative but not as critical as loss behavior
for risk tolerance. However, it could be a tie-breaker. If someone is conservative
elsewhere but here says they’d buy more on a +40% gain, that’s an interesting contrast
(perhaps indicating they fear losses but love chasing gains – a potentially problematic
combo). Scoring: (a) would be scored on the lower side (shows some risk aversion,
maybe 30 points), (b) moderate (50 points, as it’s balanced), (c) higher (70 points,
showing aggression). We don’t give (c) a full 100 because doubling down on a gain is
not purely risk tolerance – it could be impulsiveness or overconfidence. We keep the
weight modest. Its main role is qualitative: it will help the advisor understand the client’s
mindset (e.g., if the client tends to lock profits, they might value capital preservation
more than growth, even if they can handle volatility).

Section C – Knowledge & Experience Questions (Primarily for
compliance and context; minimal or no weight on risk score, but influences
product suitability):
Q13. Knowledge of Investment Products: “Which of the following instruments are you
familiar with or have you invested in before? (Select all that apply.) – Stocks/equities,
Bonds or sukuk (fixed-income), Investment funds or ETFs, Foreign currencies/FX,
Derivatives (futures, options), Cryptocurrencies, None of these.”

Purpose: This question updates the original q12. It serves to document the client’s
knowledge and experience with various asset classes. It’s crucial for ensuring we
don’t recommend products beyond the client’s understanding (MiFID II appropriateness
test). Each selected item indicates the client at least knows or has used it. If “none” is
selected, that indicates a novice investor, so a simpler portfolio and more education is
needed. - Regulatory Basis: This is directly in line with SPK’s uygunluk testi
requirements (knowing how much the client knows about capital market instruments) [1]
and MiFID II’s requirement to assess the client’s investment knowledge and
experience [12]. Checking the boxes of products they know is a straightforward way to
do this. Many EU suitability questionnaires have a similar multi-select section. -
Scoring: Not scored as part of risk tolerance. This is segregated. However, if a client
checks many complex instruments, it implies they might also be comfortable with
complexity and perhaps volatility, but we will not assume that without their attitude
answers. Instead, we use this information to tailor the discussion and ensure any
high-risk instrument (like derivatives or crypto) is only in their portfolio if they ticked
familiarity and their risk tolerance supports it. If a client checks “none,” it doesn’t mean
they have low risk tolerance per se (they could be a newbie who’s very risk-seeking but
just never invested). It simply means we must tread carefully with complex products
regardless of their risk score. So this question is a compliance check and a context flag.
Q14. Interest in Specific Risky Assets: “Are you interested in or planning to invest in
any of the following? (Select any that apply or ‘none’): Newly-issued IPO stocks,
Small-cap/Frontier market stocks, High-yield bonds, Cryptocurrencies or digital assets,
Complex derivatives or leveraged products, None of the above.”
Purpose: This question refines the original q11. It tells us the client’s inclination
towards various high-risk opportunities. If a client proactively selects these, it suggests a
higher risk appetite or at least curiosity. However, unlike knowledge (Q13), interest can
outpace understanding – someone might be interested in crypto without really knowing
it well. So this is more about preferences and values. For instance, some clients
specifically want crypto exposure or IPOs because they hear about them. This helps the
advisor incorporate client preferences into the IPS (Investment Policy Statement) in a
controlled way (or explain why they may not be suitable). - Regulation: Not strictly
required, but it can be argued it falls under understanding the client’s investment
objectives and preferences (MiFID II requires considering client’s stated preferences,
including ESG or ethical, which could be analogous to including or excluding crypto,
etc.). Also, asking this and documenting it can protect the firm: if a client later demands
“Why didn’t you put me in that hot IPO?”, the advisor can reference this. Or conversely,
if the client insists on crypto, we at least knew it upfront. - Behavioral Insight: If a client
ticks many of these high-risk interests, it may confirm an aggressive risk attitude (or
potentially overconfidence/novelty-seeking ). If a client ticks “none” or even “I prefer
not to say,” they likely are not comfortable with these areas – aligning with a
conservative stance. We will use this qualitatively. For instance, an overconfident
client might tick many interests without having knowledge (tick crypto in Q14 but not in
Q13); this discrepancy is telling and should be addressed (education or tempering
expectations). - Scoring: No direct score. It’s another context flag. Possibly, if a client
indicates strong interest in very risky assets but their risk tolerance score comes out
low, we need to discuss that discrepancy – are they chasing returns without
understanding risk? That’s a coaching opportunity, not something to resolve via
algorithm. Thus, we keep this separate from the risk scoring.
Q15. Ethical/Religious Investment Preferences: “Do you have any ethical, religious,
or other constraints on the types of investments in your portfolio? (e.g.,
Sharia-compliant investments, ESG focus, avoiding certain industries) – Yes/No. If yes,
please specify.”

Purpose: While not about risk tolerance, this is included to make the questionnaire
holistic. In the scenario description, it mentions discussing dini/etik hassasiyetler
(religious/ethical sensitivities). This question ensures we capture any investment
constraints that are not about risk but about suitability and preference. For example,
a client might only want low-risk investments not just because of risk tolerance but
because they consider speculation unethical. Or they may avoid certain sectors. This
influences portfolio design and is typically part of IPS creation. - Regulatory: Under
MiFID II’s newer regulations, sustainability preferences must be collected (if the client
wants ESG investments, etc.). Also, respecting religious restrictions (like no
interest-bearing instruments for a Sharia-focused client) is part of duty of care. KVKK
(Turkey’s data protection law) would consider religious affiliation sensitive data, so we
must ask and store this carefully (and only if relevant). By asking generally and
optionally, we comply with privacy – the client can choose to answer or not. - Scoring:
No role in risk scoring. This is purely to guide asset selection in the recommended
portfolio. If they say yes and specify (e.g. “Islamic finance only”), the advisor will restrict
the universe (e.g., use participation funds instead of conventional bonds). It doesn’t
change whether they are conservative or aggressive, but it might limit options (for
example, an aggressive investor with Sharia constraint can’t use conventional bonds or
interest-bearing tools, so we’d achieve high risk via equity only, etc.).
These new 15 questions (Q1–Q15 as outlined) cover: demographics/capacity
(Q1–Q5) , risk attitude and behavioral tendencies (Q6–Q12) , and
knowledge/preferences (Q13–Q15). Each question is rooted in either academic
research or regulatory guidance, and formulated to avoid bias and redundancy. The
design draws on behavioral finance (prospect theory, loss aversion, overconfidence,
mental accounting) to ensure we measure deep-seated attitudes, not just superficial
answers. Next, we detail how the scoring algorithm will use these responses to compute
a risk score and profile.

3. Risk Scoring Algorithm and Weighting Methodology
Total Risk Score: We will calculate a composite Risk Score on a 0–100 scale to
quantify the client’s risk tolerance. The scoring is primarily driven by the Risk Tolerance
questions (Q6–Q12) , as these reflect the client’s willingness and ability to emotionally
handle risk. The demographic/capacity factors (Q1–Q5) influence the outcome as
adjustments or constraints, rather than direct additions to the score. The
knowledge/preferences (Q13–Q15) are kept separate for product suitability filtering,
not as part of the numeric score.
Here’s how we propose computing the score:
● Base Risk Attitude Score (0–100): Compute this from Q6–Q12. Each of these
questions will be scored on a scale (we’ve indicated low/medium/high point
assignments in Section 2). We will use a weighted sum or average of these
responses:
● High-impact questions (Q6 Loss scenario, Q7 Self-classification) have larger
weights, say ~15% each. Q8, Q10, Q11 (gauging risk/return choice, loss
aversion, volatility tolerance) could be ~10% each. Q9 (experience/confidence)
and Q12 (gain scenario) might be ~5% each. These sum to
15+15+10+10+10+5+5 = 70% (if we consider them 7 questions with weights that
sum to 70%). We can then normalize to 100. Example: If a client chooses all
highest risk options, base score ~100. If all lowest, base ~0.
● We will ensure the weighting reflects the proven predictive power or relevance
of each question. For instance, Q6 and Q7 are core (heavily weighted) because
they directly tie to behavior in losses and self-assessed risk appetite, which are
strong predictors of suitable equity exposure [7] [23]. Q8 and Q11 are also
important, capturing risk aversion in gains and volatility tolerance, respectively –
significant but slightly less direct, hence mid-weight. Q9 and Q12 are
supplementary indicators (overconfidence, profit-taking behavior) – useful but not
primary, hence lower weight.
● The result is a raw psychological risk tolerance score.
● Risk Capacity Adjustment: After the base score, we adjust for capacity from
Q1–Q5:
● We define a Risk Capacity Index (not directly shown to client, for internal use)
that rates capacity as Low, Medium, High. For example, an older client (>65),
with low net worth and no emergency fund would be “Low” capacity. A young,
high-net-worth client with stable income and emergency cash is “High” capacity.
● Rather than converting this to a number and averaging (which CFA Institute
warns against [3] [4] ), we use a rule-based adjustment:

o If capacity is Low : cap the risk score to a lower maximum. For instance,
even if their answers gave them 80/100, we might cap effective score at,
say, 50 or 60, and label them no higher than “Moderate” risk in category.
Low capacity triggers a “red light” condition as described in literature: if
risk required exceeds capacity, you must reevaluate goals [36].
o If capacity is High : we allow the risk score to stand or even tilt up slightly if
on the borderline. High capacity doesn’t force someone to be risky
(willingness still governs), but it means no downward adjustment is
needed. For example, a high-capacity client with a score of 40 (moderate
tolerance) will still be recommended moderate risk – we don’t force them
higher, we just don’t restrict them lower either.
o If capacity is Medium : no change; their score stands as-is.
● Specific implementation: We could subtract some points for each capacity
shortfall. E.g., client >65 might automatically subtract 5 points (for shorter
horizon), if net worth is lowest bracket subtract 5, if no emergency fund subtract
10, etc. These could sum up: a worst-case client might lose ~20 points off their
score, effectively lowering one risk category. Conversely, a young wealthy client
might get a +5 or +10 buffer (but not exceeding 100) – though generally we don’t
need to add, we just avoid subtracting.
● Literature support: The idea is to ensure the final recommendation is within
both tolerance and ability. CFA’s guide suggests not averaging them blindly, but
to consider each separately – effectively, use the lower of the two in a strict
sense [17] [4]. Our approach approximates that: if there’s a big gap (high tolerance
but low capacity), the low capacity dominates by capping the result. If high
capacity but low tolerance, low tolerance dominates (we never force a cautious
client to go high risk just because they can afford it).
● Example: A 30-year-old (no deduction) with high income (no deduction) and high
wealth (no deduction) who answers moderately on attitude might get a raw 50
which stays 50. A 70-year-old with low income/wealth who answered
aggressively might get raw 80 but capacity adjustments knock it to ~50. This way,
the final risk score aligns with the prudent risk level.
● Sub-scores for Risk Categories: We can also compute ancillary sub-scores:
● Market Risk Appetite Score: largely the same as the base risk score (since that
reflects willingness to take market risk).
● Liquidity Need Score: based on Q2 (horizon) and Q5 (emergency fund). For
instance, we could rate liquidity risk tolerance (or rather liquidity preference ) on a
scale: a short horizon and no cash = very low tolerance for illiquid investments; a
long horizon and good cash reserves = high tolerance for locking in investments.
This sub-score would inform how much of the portfolio can be in less liquid
assets (like real estate, private equity, etc., if relevant) or how much to keep in
cash. It’s not traditionally in risk tolerance, but it’s useful for IPS. We might simply
note liquidity needs as High/Medium/Low rather than numeric.
● Volatility Tolerance Score: based on Q11 (volatility comfort) and partially
Q6/Q10 (since loss aversion ties in). This would indicate how much fluctuation

the client can stomach year to year. We could express this as a % range (e.g.,
client can tolerate ~15% annual volatility without distress). That helps in choosing
a portfolio whose expected volatility is in that range.
● These sub-scores are not separately reported as numbers to the client typically,
but used internally to shape the strategy. For example, two clients might both be
“Balanced 50/100” in overall score, but one might hate illiquidity – so we give
them all liquid mutual funds; another might be fine locking some money – so we
might include real estate or private equity funds for diversification.
● Risk Score to Risk Category: We interpret the 0–100 score into qualitative risk
profiles:
● 0–30: “Conservative” – very low tolerance. Prioritize capital preservation. Minimal
equities (if any), focus on fixed income, deposits, etc.
● 31–60: “Moderate/Balanced” – medium tolerance. A mix of stocks and bonds.
Will accept some ups and downs for moderate growth.
● 61–100: “Aggressive” – high tolerance. High equity exposure, perhaps alternative
investments. Accepts significant volatility for higher long-term returns.
● (We could also refine into five bands – e.g. 0–20 Very Conservative, 21–
Moderately Conservative, 41–60 Balanced, 61–80 Growth, 81–100 Very
Aggressive – to match common industry practice of 5 risk levels. The exact
number of categories can be adjusted to the firm’s preference; the prompt
example shows 3 bands, but some frameworks use 5 for nuance. For brevity,
we’ll illustrate 3 here.)
● These cut-offs are somewhat flexible; they should be validated with data (e.g.,
ensure that historical portfolios mapped to those scores indeed align with client
expectations). We chose them based on the notion that a truly aggressive profile
should be relatively rare (top quartile of score perhaps).
● Justification: Simpler categories make it easier for clients to understand and for
compliance to approve. Industry practice (e.g., Vanguard or Fidelity model
portfolios) often boils down to Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive labels [37] [38].
We align with that, and our numerical score provides a more granular measure
within those bands if needed.
● Example Calculation: Consider a client who answered as follows: Age 45, long
horizon >10yrs, high income, medium net worth, has emergency fund; Q6 (20%
loss reaction) chose “hold” (mid), Q7 self-identified “balanced” (mid), Q8 chose
the moderate gamble (b), Q9 said some experience (b), Q10 said losses/gains
affect equally (b), Q11 said “a bit concerned but tolerate” (b), Q12 said “rebalance
later” (b). This person consistently answers the middle option. Their base risk
attitude score might come out ~50. Capacity is fine (no major constraints), so
final score ~50. They fall in Moderate. Another client: Age 30, long horizon, high
wealth, no emergency fund (small ding), Q6 “buy more” (high), Q7 “opportunistic
high risk” (high), Q8 picks the riskiest (c), Q9 “extensive experience” (c), Q
“focus long term, losses don’t faze” (c), Q11 “comfortable with volatility” (c), Q
“buy more/ride” (c). This is uniformly aggressive. Base score ~95. Capacity is
high except no emergency fund – we might knock off a few points or at least

caution. Still, final might be ~85 which is “Aggressive.” We’d note the lack of
emergency fund as something to fix (maybe suggest they set one up with part of
the portfolio in cash). Conversely, a very cautious client might answer all (a)’s,
yielding base ~5 or 10. If that client was also older with low capacity, final
remains in the lowest bracket “Conservative.”
In summary, the algorithm prioritizes the client’s expressed risk tolerance
(psychometric score) but tempered by their capacity. This dual approach is rooted in
both regulatory guidance and financial planning best practice: ensure the client’s
portfolio not only matches their comfort level but also doesn’t expose them to losses
they objectively cannot afford [39] [18]. By attributing clear weights to each question
(grounded in literature) and using rule-based adjustments, the scoring is transparent
and justifiable. Each weight has a “scientific” rationale – e.g., heavy weight on loss
reaction because of its predictive validity, lighter on confidence because of potential
biases.
We will document these weights and the scoring model, and importantly, we will test
and validate it (see Section 6 on validity) to ensure it produces reliable profiles.

4. Integration of Behavioral Finance Principles
Our redesigned questionnaire consciously embeds concepts from behavioral finance
to more accurately gauge true risk tolerance and to avoid pitfalls like biased answers.
Here’s how key behavioral theories are integrated:
● Prospect Theory & Loss Aversion: Prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky)
tells us that people feel losses more intensely than gains and that they become
risk-seeking when trying to avoid a sure loss [26] [20]. We reflect this in multiple
ways:
● Several questions (Q6, Q10, Q11) directly assess how the client perceives and
reacts to losses or volatility. Q6’s 20% loss scenario is a classic test of loss
aversion: an investor who sells immediately confirms a high loss aversion
(unable to tolerate the pain of loss), whereas one who holds or buys more is less
loss-averse. Q10 explicitly asks if losses bother them more than gains please
them (using the phrase “losses loom larger than gains” to see if they agree) – a
direct reference to prospect theory’s finding [20].
● In Q8, we implicitly used prospect theory framing by giving one option with a sure
smaller gain vs. gambles. Many average investors will choose the sure gain
(risk-averse in gain domain), whereas those willing to take the gamble for more
gain are showing lower risk aversion. By analyzing which option clients choose,
we glean how their utility function might be curved – concave (risk averse) or
closer to linear/convex (risk tolerant).
● We also avoid one common mistake: we do not rely on one single “Would you
accept a sure loss vs gamble?” question, because research indicates many
people’s theoretical choices might not fully map to their investing behavior [8].
Instead, we incorporate loss aversion assessment through scenarios and
self-reporting combined, for a richer picture.

● Use in scoring: Those exhibiting strong loss aversion (e.g., choose all the
cautious options) will end up with a low score, flagging that even moderate
portfolio losses might cause them disproportionate distress. Our algorithm
weights those responses heavily, effectively implementing the principle that
highly loss-averse clients should be in conservative allocations to prevent
emotional selling [7].
● Mental Accounting: Mental accounting (Thaler, 1985) is the tendency for people
to separate their money into different “accounts” mentally and treat them
differently [40]. This can lead to irrational allocation – e.g., taking high risk in a
“fun money” account while being very conservative in a retirement account, even
though money is fungible. We addressed this in a few ways:
● Q5 about emergency funds ensures we know if the client has mentally separated
“safety money” from “investment money.” If they haven’t (no emergency fund), it
means they are implicitly counting on this portfolio for liquidity too – so they won’t
mentally treat it as a purely long-term growth account. That’s a form of mental
accounting insight: a client with no separate rainy-day fund will treat the
investment as also the rainy-day fund, implying lower risk tolerance in practice.
We respond by adjusting the risk profile accordingly (don’t put all money in
volatile assets if the client has no separate cushion).
● Q12 on what they do with a big gain touches mental accounting: taking profit
(option a) could indicate they mentally “bank” the gain in a safe mental account
(“house money” idea), whereas letting it ride (option c) implies they keep it in the
same mental bucket as before (willing to risk it further). This helps identify who is
likely to pocket gains versus who is likely to press for more. The former might
have a mental goal like “I want to at least secure X amount” – once achieved,
they reset their risk appetite on that portion.
● In the IPS process, understanding mental accounting allows us to frame
recommendations better. For example, if a client is very loss-averse about their
principal but would take risk with profits, we might implement a strategy to
systematically take some profits off the table to satisfy that mental need. Or if a
client has different goal buckets (college fund vs retirement), we might do
separate risk assessments per goal.
● We try to minimize any framing in questions that would trigger mental accounting
biases inadvertently. For instance, we don’t phrase questions in terms of “your
initial investment” vs “your gains” except Q12 intentionally. All other monetary
scenarios treat the money as a single pot. This is to avoid clients answering
differently just because they label money differently.
● Overconfidence Bias: Overconfidence can lead investors to overestimate their
risk tolerance and their ability to manage investments (often leading to excessive
trading and under-diversification) [29] [28]. We explicitly gauge elements of
overconfidence:
● Q9 asks about experience and confidence. A client choosing “extensive
experience, trust my own judgment” might indeed have that experience, or they

might be overestimating their skill. If their actual knowledge (Q13) doesn’t back it
(say they claim extensive experience but then indicate they’ve only used savings
accounts), that discrepancy signals overconfidence. We would then be cautious
an overconfident novice might claim high risk tolerance but then panic when
faced with complexity or losses they didn’t anticipate.
● Q14 (interest in risky assets) cross-checked with Q13 (knowledge) also reveals
overconfidence. Example: If someone has never invested in derivatives but
selects interest in leveraged products, they might be overconfident in their future
ability or are enticed by high returns without understanding risk. This again is a
flag. Behavioral research shows overconfident investors often chase exotic
investments and trade too much [29].
● The questionnaire structure allows the advisor to identify overconfidence and
discuss it. For instance, if the client’s risk score comes out high largely because
they chose aggressive options, but the advisor notes from their experience
answers that they might not fully grasp what that entails, the advisor can gently
challenge: “You indicated a high comfort with risk and complex instruments, but
also you’re new to investing – let’s talk about what taking high risk really means.”
This conversation is critical to align perception with reality, something pure
numbers can’t do alone [41].
● Framing to mitigate overconfidence: We phrase questions in a way that
doesn’t feed overconfidence. For example, we don’t ask “Do you consider
yourself more knowledgeable than average?” – many would say yes
(overconfidence effect). Instead, we ask factual experience and then separate
how confident they are. This way, the client hopefully bases their answer in fact
(“have you invested before?”) rather than a biased self-ranking.
● Framing Effect: The framing effect suggests that how choices are presented
(gain vs loss framing, wording) can alter decisions [42] [21]. We took care to
design question wording that minimizes framing bias:
● We present balanced information. For risk-reward questions (e.g., Q7), each
option mentions both risk and return, so one isn’t implicitly safer-sounding just
because we omitted the downside or upside. This avoids the risky-choice
framing where, for example, people choose differently if you frame outcomes as
“80% chance of gain” vs “20% chance of loss” even though they’re the same.
● We avoid emotionally charged or leading words. Terms like “secure”, “risky”,
“aggressive”, “safe” can mean different things to different people [43]. We used
plain descriptions or numeric examples instead. For instance, we say “value
drops 20%” rather than “suffers a big loss” – the former is neutral, the latter might
scare (loss-framing). Similarly, we don’t label an option “aggressive investor”
(which some might avoid due to connotation); instead we describe the behavior
and let them choose.
● We ensure scenarios are realistic but not extreme to the point of framing bias. A
20% drop example is significant but not catastrophic (if we said 80% drop, almost
everyone would choose to sell – it’s too extreme, not informative for
distinguishing typical risk profiles). A +40% gain scenario is big but not
unimaginable – enough to see differences in behavior without being a no-brainer.
● We also considered order of questions as a framing factor: starting a survey
with age/income (factual, non-emotional) then moving to scenarios sets a neutral
tone. If we started with “imagine you lose money...” it might frame the whole
survey negatively. We put profile first, then gradually into risk scenarios. This
should put the client in a reflective mindset about their finances before asking
their preferences, hopefully reducing snap responses.
● Additionally, by including both loss scenarios and gain scenarios, we avoid
one-sided framing. If we only asked about losses, the client might get into an
overly cautious mindset; if only gains, maybe overly optimistic. We do both,
giving a more rounded framing.
● Lastly, we refrain from showing any “expert recommendations” within questions
(as per CFA guideline: never say “experts do X, what about you?” [11] ). All
options are presented as equally valid personal choices, so the client doesn’t feel
there is a correct answer. This encourages truthful responses rather than framed
ones.
Incorporating these behavioral insights makes the questionnaire more robust. It goes
beyond a checklist – it tries to surface the why behind a client’s answers. For instance, if
someone’s pattern of answers suggests strong loss aversion and maybe regret
avoidance (e.g., selling winners quickly), we know their psychology and can craft an IPS
that addresses that (maybe more stable investments, periodic profit-taking to reassure
them, etc.). By explicitly measuring biases like loss aversion and overconfidence, we
aim to prevent mismatches where a client’s biases could later derail the plan (like
overconfident clients wanting to deviate from strategy or loss-averse clients wanting to
sell at bottoms).
In summary, behavioral finance integration ensures the risk profile isn’t just a number
but a reflection of how the client is likely to behave under real investment conditions – a
critical factor for a successful long-term investment plan.

5. Regulatory and Compliance Considerations
Designing the risk profiling questionnaire requires adherence to both local (Turkey) and
international regulations to ensure the process is compliant and client-friendly. Key
compliance points:
● Alignment with SPK (Turkey Capital Markets Board) Requirements: The
SPK’s regulations on suitability ( “Uygunluk Testi” ) lay out minimum elements that
must be covered [1]. Our questionnaire explicitly covers these:
● Knowledge and Experience: Q13 and Q9 address which products the client
knows and their investing experience level, fulfilling the requirement to gauge
how well the investor understands various instruments [1]. For instance, SPK
expects questions on whether the client has traded stocks, bonds, etc.; our Q
ticks that box.

● Financial Situation: Q3 (assets), Q4 (income), Q5 (liquidity) gather information
about the client’s financial capacity. This is in line with ensuring the firm knows
the client’s ability to bear losses [12]. Turkish regulations similarly require knowing
the client’s financial profile (e.g., income, assets, regular obligations perhaps) to
judge suitability.
● Risk and Return Preferences: Our core risk tolerance questions (Q6–Q12)
cover the client’s risk and return preferences extensively, which is exactly what
SPK’s “risk ve getiri tercihiniz” refers to [1]. We go beyond the minimum of just
asking “are you conservative or aggressive” by using scenarios and detailed
queries, which actually surpasses basic compliance and moves into best-interest
territory.
● Documentation and Warnings: In SPK’s framework, after the test, if a client
wants to invest in something outside their profile, the firm must warn them [39].
Our design helps make those determinations solidly – e.g., if a client scores as
low risk but wants leveraged forex, we can show (via Q13/Q14) they have
interest but not tolerance, and thus provide the mandated warning (perhaps
referencing their own answers: “You indicated a low risk tolerance, so leveraged
forex isn’t suitable, but if you insist...” as per the required disclaimer [44] ).
● Professional vs Retail: The SPK rules allow that professional investors might
skip the full suitability test. Our questionnaire is primarily for retail (wealthy but
still retail) clients. If an individual qualifies as a professional client, the depth of
questioning could be adjusted (maybe they don’t need basic knowledge
questions). However, given our high-net-worth scenario is likely still a retail client
in regulatory terms (unless they meet specific criteria), we assume full
questionnaire is needed. We can easily tweak it if a client is classified as
“professional” to omit some parts as law permits [45].
● MiFID II (EU) Suitability Requirements: Since many best practices in Turkey
mirror EU standards (as Turkey often looks to ESMA guidance):
● MiFID II requires collecting information on knowledge & experience, financial
situation (including ability to bear losses), and investment objectives
(including risk tolerance) [12]. Our questionnaire is structured exactly around
these pillars:
o Knowledge & Experience: Q13, Q9, and partially Q14.
o Financial Situation (ability to bear loss): Q3, Q4, Q5 (net worth, income,
emergency fund) all indicate how much loss the client can absorb without
hardship [2] [18].
o Investment Objectives/Risk Tolerance: Q2 (horizon) covers objectives
timeline, Q6–Q12 cover risk tolerance extensively.
● Ability to Bear Loss explicitly in MiFID II: We address this by asking not only net
worth but indirectly through Q5 (emergency fund) and Q6 (what do you do in a
loss scenario). Q6’s outcome can indicate if the client can emotionally bear
losses, but financially, Q3 and Q4 give clues (small asset base means even a
small loss might derail goals).

● Record-Keeping and Appropriateness: If the client were doing an
appropriateness test for trading (where no advice is given), usually only
knowledge/experience is assessed. But for suitability (portfolio
management/advisory), we need this full spectrum. Our design would satisfy an
auditor that we have a comprehensive risk profile on record. We would, of
course, also ensure we keep this data confidential and updated periodically
(MiFID requires asking for updates if things change, etc.).
● ESMA Guidelines Influence: ESMA guidelines (2018) also emphasize asking
questions that clients can understand and that actually measure what they need
to [46]. We’ve taken care to make questions plain and not overly technical,
fulfilling the spirit of that guidance. For example, ESMA discourages blunt
questions like “Are you willing to take high risk? Yes/No” because clients may not
understand or may all just say “medium” – our approach is more scenario-based
and nuanced, which is better.
● KVKK (Turkish Personal Data Protection) and GDPR: Since the user is in
Istanbul and we mention KVKK:
● We collect personal data (age, income, etc.) which is allowed as it’s necessary
for providing investment advice – this falls under lawful processing (contract or
compliance obligation). However, we must ensure data security and client
consent. In practice, at the start of the questionnaire (especially digital tablet
form), we’d include a brief consent or privacy notice: explaining why we ask
these questions and that the data will be used to determine suitable investments,
in line with regulations [47] , and it will be stored securely.
● We avoid asking for data that’s not necessary. For instance, we do not ask for
things like ID numbers, addresses, health or family status in this risk
questionnaire. Those might be gathered in other onboarding forms but are not
needed here. By limiting to relevant info, we comply with data minimization
principles of KVKK/GDPR.
● Sensitive Data: We do gently touch on potential religious preferences in Q15,
which could be sensitive. We frame it broadly (ethical/religious) and optional. If
the client says yes, we only record the details they volunteer (e.g., “wants
Sharia-compliant” or “no tobacco stocks”). This is client-provided preference
data, used solely to tailor investments, which is permitted as long as we handle it
with higher protection (marked confidential, possibly not used for any other
purpose). We may also obtain explicit consent if needed for storing this
preference, though generally, preference data for providing the service might be
covered under contractual necessity.
● We ensure all these responses are kept confidential within the firm and used only
for their intended purpose (suitability assessment), adhering to KVKK’s purpose
limitation. For digital storage, data encryption and access controls will be in
place, given the sensitivity (financial and personal profile information is sensitive
in nature).
● Validity and Fairness: Regulators expect that the risk profiling process is not
just a formality but actually helps the client. Thus, we ensure:

● No misleading or manipulative questions: As discussed earlier, we avoid
questions that bias the client or prompt a certain answer [48]. This is both a
behavioral point and a compliance one – a mis-selling scandal could arise if, say,
a questionnaire was designed to nudge everyone to “Aggressive” so the firm can
sell risky products. Our questions are neutral to prevent that.
● Clarity for the Client: ESMA guidelines say firms should ensure clients
understand the questions and the importance of answering accurately [12] [46]. To
implement this, at the start of the survey (or via the advisor’s introduction), we will
inform the client in plain language: “This questionnaire helps determine what
level of investment risk is suitable for you. There are no right or wrong answers –
it’s important to answer truthfully about your preferences and situation.” This
manages expectations and complies with the guideline to inform clients of the
purpose of the suitability assessment [49] [50].
● We also likely will have a note (especially for robo-advisory contexts) that “The
answers you provide will directly impact the investments we recommend to
you” [51] – making it clear their score influences their portfolio, encouraging
thoughtful responses.
● SPK and MiFID II Updates: We should note if any new guidelines (e.g.,
incorporating ESG preferences as of 2022 in EU, or any local changes) are in
effect by 2025. We have covered ESG in Q15 superficially. If needed, a couple
more detailed questions on sustainability preferences could be added to fully
comply with MiFID II 2022 amendments (but the prompt didn’t explicitly ask, so
we keep it minimal).
● Compliance Workflow: Once the questionnaire is filled:
● The system/ advisor computes the risk score and tentative risk category.
● If the client’s chosen products or requests fall outside their risk category,
compliance rules require a warning and possibly client’s written consent to
proceed with that mismatch [44]. Our design helps identify those mismatches
clearly (e.g., if risk score is “Conservative” but client expressed interest in crypto
and IPOs, the advisor will either educate the client or if client insists, record that
they’ve been warned as per SPK’s standard text [44] ).
● The results become part of the client’s file. Under regulations, we should update
this profile periodically (say every 1-2 years or when a significant life event
occurs). The questionnaire can be re-administered or edited in the future – it’s
designed in modular sections so updates are easy (e.g., if income changes, just
Q4 is updated; if risk attitude changes, redo Q6–Q12).
In essence, our questionnaire and process are built to satisfy regulatory standards in
both spirit and letter. We cover all required areas, use understandable language for
clients, protect their data, and have a mechanism to handle mismatches or changes. By
documenting the rationale for each question (as we have done) and citing regulatory
references, we also create a strong audit trail to show regulators (or internal
compliance) that our risk profiling approach is comprehensive and up-to-date with the
latest guidelines [52] [53].

6. Final Outputs: Proposed Questions, Scoring Formula, and
Implementation Plan
Finally, we consolidate the outcome of the redesign into concrete deliverables:

6.1. New Risk Profiling Questionnaire (15 Questions with Rationale &
Weights)
Below is a summary list of the new questions, each mapped to its purpose and weight in
scoring:

Age Range? (0% weight in score; used in capacity assessment) – Captures
investor’s stage of life (risk capacity via horizon).
Investment Horizon? (0% weight; capacity factor) – Indicates how long money
can stay invested (short = less risk capacity).
Total Investable Assets? (0% weight; capacity factor) – Gauges financial
buffer/ability to absorb losses [2] [18].
Annual Income & Stability? (0% weight; capacity factor) – Higher stable
income = greater ability to take risk.
Emergency Fund Available? (0% weight; capacity factor) – No emergency fund
= portfolio must be more liquid/safer to cover surprises.
Reaction to a 20% Portfolio Loss? (~15% weight) – Measures loss tolerance
and composure [7]. (a: Sell = Low risk tolerance; b: Hold = Medium; c: Buy more
= High).
General Risk-Return Preference? (~15% weight) – Self-assessed risk appetite.
(a: Safety first = Low; b: Balanced = Medium; c: High risk/high return = High).
Choice: Sure Gain vs. Risky Gains? (~10% weight) – Tests risk aversion in
gains domain (and slight loss chance). (a: Sure small gain = Very low; b: 50/50
moderate = Medium; c: 30% chance big gain/loss = High) [27].
Experience & Confidence Level? (~5% weight) – Overconfidence gauge. (a:
Novice, low confidence = might lower effective tolerance; b: Some experience =
neutral; c: Very experienced/confident = could slightly raise tolerance) [28].
Psychological Impact: Gains vs Losses? (~10% weight) – Assesses loss
aversion. (a: Losses hurt more = Low tolerance [20] ; b: Equal = Medium; c:
Losses don’t faze = High).
Comfort with Portfolio Volatility? (~10% weight) – Assesses volatility
tolerance. (a: Very anxious with swings = Low; b: somewhat okay = Medium; c:
not bothered = High).
Reaction to Big Investment Gain? (~5% weight) – Reveals if they take profits
or risk more (greed vs caution). (a: Lock profit = a bit conservative; b: Rebalance
= disciplined/medium; c: ride/add = risk-tolerant or overconfident).
Instruments Familiar With (multi-select)? (0% weight) – Knowledge check
(stocks, bonds, funds, FX, derivatives, crypto). Used to filter suitable products [1].
Risky Assets of Interest (multi-select)? (0% weight) – Preference check for
IPOs, crypto, etc. Flags if interest exceeds risk capacity or knowledge.
Ethical/Religious Constraints? (0% weight) – Ensures compliance with client’s
values (Sharia, ESG) in portfolio construction.
(Questions 1–5 and 13–15 are not scored but are critical for suitability and IPS
personalization. Questions 6–12 sum to 100% of the risk attitude score, distributed
approximately as noted.)
Each question’s weighting was chosen based on its predictive importance. For
example, Q6 and Q7 get the highest weights because willingness to bear losses and
stated risk preference are strongly indicative of appropriate equity levels [7] [23]. Lower
weights like 5% are assigned to supplementary indicators (Q9, Q12) so they fine-tune
but don’t dominate the score.
6.2. Risk Score Calculation Formula
The Risk Score (0–100) is calculated through a weighted sum of the scored questions
(Q6–Q12), then adjusted for capacity factors:
● Step 1: Score each of Q6–Q12 on a scale of 0 to 100 (or 0 to some points)
according to the option chosen. For instance: Q6: a=0, b=50, c=100; Q7: a=20,
b=60, c=100; etc. (We will tabulate exact scores for each option as part of
implementation, ensuring roughly that an “average/middle” answer yields ~50
points and the most extreme yields 0 or 100).
● Step 2: Apply Weights: Use a formula like:
Base Risk Score = 0.15Score(Q6) + 0.15Score(Q7) + 0.10Score(Q8) +
0.05Score(Q9) + 0.10Score(Q10) + 0.10Score(Q11) + 0.05*Score(Q12) (if
using percentage weights).
This will produce a weighted average out of 100. Weights sum to 0.70 here by
design (15+15+10+5+10+10+5 = 70). We can normalize by 0.70 to scale to 100,
or more simply, assign higher point values internally so that the total can reach

For clarity, we might just assign points such that maximum total = 100
without normalization:
● e.g., Q6 max 15 points, Q7 max 15, Q8 max 10, Q9 max 5, Q10 max 10, Q1 1
max 10, Q12 max 5. That sums to max 70, so we’d then multiply by ~1.43 or just
allow the scale to be 0–70 and then map to 0–100. An alternate approach:
increase each weight proportionally (e.g., double them to sum 140 and then
scale down). The exact arithmetic will be handled in the implementation code, but
conceptually each question contributes its weight’s worth of points.
● Step 3: Determine preliminary Risk Category from the Base Score. For
instance, Base Score 0–30 = “Conservative”, 31–60 = “Moderate”, 61–100 =
“Aggressive”. This preliminary category is based purely on the client’s expressed
preferences.
● Step 4: Adjust for Capacity: Review responses to Q1–Q5:
● If any hard constraints are hit (e.g., Q2 horizon < 1 year, or Q5 says no
emergency fund and this is their entire life savings), consider reducing category
by one level. For example, a Moderate base might be labeled Conservative-final
if capacity is very low.
● Implement a point deduction scheme: e.g., if >65 years, subtract 5 points; if
lowest wealth bracket, subtract 5; if no emergency fund, subtract 10; if low
income, subtract 5. These particular values are somewhat subjective – we’d
calibrate them so that a client hitting all “low capacity” flags might drop perhaps
~20–25 points (enough to shift one category). High capacity could conversely
have a minor addition (but we usually don’t add because risk tolerance shouldn’t
be inflated beyond what they state, we just don’t want to penalize unnecessarily).
● Ensure after adjustment, score is not below 0 or above 100 (floor and cap).
● Outcome: This yields the Final Risk Score and corresponding Risk Category.
For instance, Base 65 (Aggressive) with a –15 adjustment (due to some capacity
limits) = 50 Final, which is Moderate category.
● Step 5: Document the Final Profile: The final output would state something
like: “Risk Score: 50/100 – Risk Profile: Moderate.” Along with notes: “Capacity
constraints noted: [e.g., short horizon]” if any, and “Client preferences noted:
[e.g., interested in crypto, requires Sharia compliance].” These qualitative notes
ensure the context is clear.
This formula and process ensure transparency. If a client asks “Why am I moderate,
not aggressive?”, the advisor can explain: “Your answers to the attitude questions gave
you a moderately high score, but since you mentioned you might need the money in 2
years for a house (short horizon), we dialed it down to moderate to be safe.” Such an
explanation is grounded in the formula above and the weights we’ve justified with
research.
We will also incorporate consistency checks in the algorithm: - If the client gave
contradictory answers (e.g., one question very high, another very low), the overall score
will fall in the middle, but the advisor interface will flag the inconsistencies. For example,
if Q7 “I’m very risk-averse” but Q6 “I’d buy more after a loss,” that’s inconsistent –
maybe the client didn’t understand something. The advisor might double-check those
with the client. This isn’t a formula step per se, but a design consideration for
implementation to ensure validity (see testing below).

6.3. Recommended Portfolio Allocations by Risk Category
For each risk category determined by the score, we propose a model portfolio allocation
(which can be a starting point for the IPS). These allocations are aligned with global
standards and literature on risk-return tradeoff [54] [55] :
● Conservative (Score ~0–30): Primary goal = capital preservation. A
Conservative Portfolio might be ~ 20% equities, 75% bonds, 5% cash (or
equivalents) [56] [57]. The focus is on generating a modest return with minimal
volatility. For example, heavy in high-quality bonds and maybe some dividend
stocks or blue-chip equity for inflation hedge. Source: Industry models describe
conservative portfolios as heavily weighted to fixed income [57] , often 20-30%
equity at most. This matches our suggestion (e.g., Investopedia notes

conservative models allocate a large percentage to lower-risk securities like
bonds [57] ).
● Expected Volatility: Low (perhaps annual volatility ~5-8%). Suitable for clients
who cannot stomach losses or have short horizons.
● Example: If client’s goal is wealth preservation or a near-term need, this portfolio
might be recommended.
● Moderate/Balanced (Score ~31–60): Goal = balanced growth and stability. A
Balanced Portfolio often is around 50% equities and 50% fixed income (give
or take) [15] [55]. We can refine to ~ 50-60% equity, 40-50% bonds , minimal cash
(for liquidity). This mix seeks a middle ground: enough equity for growth, enough
bonds to buffer downturns. Source: Balanced portfolios are commonly 50/50; in
fact, moderately aggressive portfolios are often called balanced and divided
almost equally between stocks and bonds [54] , with about 50% equities [55].
● Expected Volatility: Medium (maybe ~10-12% annual). Historically, such a mix
provides moderate returns with manageable swings.
● Example composition: global equity funds, some Turkish equities if appropriate,
mixed bond funds (govt and corporate), maybe small allocation to alternatives
(like REITs) if within risk tolerance.
● This suits clients with medium to long horizons who want growth but also want to
avoid big crashes. Many “balanced” investors also prefer seeing not all eggs in
one basket.
● Aggressive (Score ~61–100): Goal = high growth, accepting high volatility. An
Aggressive Portfolio could be 80% equities (or more), ~15% bonds, ~5%
cash [58]. Possibly even up to 90-100% equity for the very high end (“Very
Aggressive”). Source: Very aggressive model portfolios are typically 80-100% in
equities [58] , as noted in Investopedia’s examples.
● Expected Volatility: High (could be ~15-20%+ annual swings). This is for
investors who won’t panic during large drawdowns and have a long-term focus.
● Composition: Majority in growth assets – equities (including emerging markets,
small-caps, etc. for extra return potential), possibly alternative investments
(private equity, commodities, etc.) for diversification but those can be volatile too.
Bond allocation is minimal, mainly for slight stability or income.
● Within aggressive, we can tailor to preferences: e.g., if they indicated interest in
crypto and their profile supports it, we might include a small crypto allocation (say
5% of portfolio) in place of some equity or alternative portion. Similarly, if they
have ethical constraints, we use ESG or Sharia-compliant equities, etc.
● Fine-tuning: For very precise tailoring, we could have 5 categories:
● Very Conservative (Score <15): ~10% equity, 90% bonds/cash (essentially all
safe assets).
● Conservative (15-30): ~20-30% equity, rest bonds/cash.
● Moderate (31-60): ~40-60% equity, rest bonds.

● Growth/Aggressive (61-80): ~70-80% equity.
● Very Aggressive (81+): ~90-100% equity.
● These are examples; the actual breakpoints can be adjusted. What’s crucial is
that the portfolio risk (measured by equity % or similar) increases with the
risk score in a logical, proportional way [13] [38].
Each category’s allocation should be backed by historical analysis (e.g., Monte Carlo or
long-term returns) to ensure it aligns with what a client in that category likely expects.
For instance, a conservative client likely expects not to lose money over, say, a 1-year
period – a 20% equity portfolio historically has a very low chance of >10% loss in a year,
which fits. An aggressive client knows they could lose 30% in a bad year – an 80%+
equity portfolio has seen such drops, and that’s communicated.
We also prepare guidance with each portfolio. For example, when presenting the risk
profile result to the client, we might include a summary: “Your profile is Aggressive. A
suitable portfolio might be ~80% in stocks. This means in a given year, it’s not unusual
to see your portfolio down 20% (or up 25%). Over long periods, this has highest growth
potential but requires patience through volatility.” This framing uses behavioral finance
to set proper expectations (anchoring them to the expected volatility so they’re mentally
prepared).
It’s worth noting these allocations also consider diversification and other constraints: -
If the client had a liquidity need, even an aggressive profile might hold a bit more cash. -
If the client has ethical exclusions, we adjust the composition (e.g., replace certain
sectors, or use specific funds). - If the client’s knowledge is limited, we might avoid very
niche assets even if interest was expressed (e.g., a client scored aggressive and is
interested in derivatives, but has no experience – we might satisfy their risk with equities
and funds rather than complex derivatives until they gain more knowledge).
Our recommended allocations align with well-known models (like those by Vanguard,
etc.), ensuring they are defensible. For example, Vanguard’s aggressive growth model
is roughly 90/10 equity/bond [58] ; our aggressive is 80/20 to 90/10, in the same spirit.

6.4. Validity and Reliability Testing Plan
After designing the questionnaire and scoring system, we must validate that it truly
works – i.e., it reliably measures risk tolerance and predicts appropriate portfolio fits. We
propose a testing protocol :
● Pilot Testing: Administer the new questionnaire to a sample of clients or
colleagues (say 30–50 people initially). We’ll include a range of known risk
profiles (some who consider themselves conservative, some aggressive) to see if
the questionnaire categorizes them accordingly. We will also ask for qualitative
feedback: did any question confuse them, did they feel the questions covered
their situation, etc. This helps establish face validity and catch any ambiguities.
● Psychometric Analysis: Using the pilot data:
● Calculate Cronbach’s Alpha for the risk attitude questions (Q6–Q12) to assess
internal consistency. We expect an alpha in the 0.7+ range for a reliable

scale [59] [60]. If alpha is low, we examine which questions might be out of line
and consider revising or dropping a problematic item.
● Perform an Item-Total Correlation check: see how each question’s score
correlates with the total risk score [61]. Items with very low correlation might not
be contributing meaningfully or might be noise. For example, if Q12 (gain
reaction) doesn’t correlate at all with total score, perhaps it’s not discriminating
well and might need rewording or reweighting.
● Check for factor structure : though our questionnaire is short, we might do an
exploratory factor analysis to see if the items align mostly on one factor (overall
risk tolerance) or multiple. Ideally, most of Q6–Q12 load on one factor
(willingness to take risk), while maybe one or two might form a second factor
(perhaps overconfidence separate). If multiple factors appear, that might indicate
we should consider reporting sub-scores or ensure the scoring model accounts
for that (the CFA psychometric review suggests risk tolerance may have
sub-dimensions, but often a single factor is dominant) [25] [62].
● Test-retest reliability: If possible, have some participants take it again after a
short interval (maybe 2–4 weeks if nothing major changed in their life). A high
correlation between the two scores indicates the questionnaire is stable (risk
tolerance shouldn’t wildly change in weeks barring external factors). We aim for a
decent test-retest correlation (maybe >0.8 for the score).
● Concurrent Validity: Compare our results with an established risk profiling tool
or advisor assessment:
● If any pilot participants had previously done a known risk questionnaire (like a
bank’s survey or the Grable & Lytton scale 0† ), compare the outcomes. Does
our “Moderate” correspond to a similar category in the other tool? We expect
broadly similar results if both are measuring the same construct.
● Alternatively, have an experienced financial advisor who knows the client rate the
client’s risk tolerance (low/med/high) independently, and see if our questionnaire
matches those qualitative opinions. If there are discrepancies, investigate why –
e.g., did our questions misclassify, or did the advisor have biases?
● Predictive Validity: This is the gold standard – does the risk score predict
behavior? While it takes time, we can:
● Track clients’ portfolios and actions over a period (1-2 years). A valid risk profile
should correlate with fewer surprises: e.g., conservative-profile clients should not
be found panic-selling even moderate portfolios because we shouldn’t have put
them in too risky allocation; aggressive clients shouldn’t complain their portfolio is
too tame or conversely bail out at first volatility (if they do, maybe they weren’t
truly aggressive). If we find, for instance, a client scored as aggressive but then
couldn’t handle the volatility, that’s a case to examine – was it a mis-assessment
or did something change?
● We might simulate scenarios: e.g., present a hypothetical downturn to a subset
of clients after they’ve been invested according to our profile and see if their
stated reaction aligns with their original answers (this is more of a controlled
experiment).

● Over time, gather statistics: what percentage of conservative clients stayed
invested during a market dip vs moderate vs aggressive. Ideally, aggressive
clients stick to plan more (because they were prepared), and conservative clients
had portfolios that didn’t dip too much so they were okay – this would validate
that the profiling + portfolio recommendation achieved its goal. If we find a
pattern of, say, moderate clients being unhappy or aggressive clients bailing out,
we may need to tweak either the questions or how we translate to portfolios.
● Refinement: Use the data to refine weights or questions:
● For example, if Q8 (gamble choice) turned out to confuse people (maybe many
left it blank or asked questions), we might simplify it or adjust the framing.
● If Cronbach’s alpha indicates one question doesn’t fit the scale, consider
replacing it. The CFA Institute paper on psychometrics emphasizes iterative
improvement – making sure each question adds value and reliability [25] [34].
● Maintain content validity : We ensure the questions collectively cover all aspects
of risk tolerance (no major facet missing). Based on literature, our questions
cover: risk aversion, loss aversion, volatility tolerance, time horizon, liquidity
needs, overconfidence, etc., which is quite comprehensive [63]. We will have
experts (e.g., experienced portfolio managers or psychologists) review if any
important angle is not asked. For instance, some might argue “What about
questions on client’s debts or obligations?” – if relevant we could add one about
obligations because if someone has big liabilities, capacity is lower. We assumed
net worth covers that implicitly, but we can consider it.
● Also ensure face validity : advisors using it should feel it “makes sense” and
covers what they normally ask in an interview [23]. The pilot feedback should
cover that. If an advisor says “I still can’t tell if the client would really panic
because we didn’t ask X,” we examine adding X.
● Periodic Review: Markets and products evolve, so the questionnaire should be
reviewed every couple of years. Also, client behavior research may yield new
insights (for example, if a new behavioral bias becomes prominent, we might
incorporate a question for it). We’ll keep an eye on updates from regulators (e.g.,
ESMA might update suitability guidelines, or SPK might refine the rule) and from
academic research to update the survey accordingly.
By conducting these validity and reliability checks, we ensure the questionnaire is not
only compliant on paper but actually effective in practice. A reliable questionnaire will
yield similar results under consistent conditions and a valid questionnaire will truly
measure risk tolerance (and related factors) rather than something else. The end goal is
that the risk profile derived from this survey leads to an IPS (Investment Policy
Statement) that the client is comfortable with and that avoids both unsuitable risk (too
high or too low) and future surprises.
Once validated, the process flows as envisioned: the relationship manager or advisor
uses this survey on a tablet during the client meeting; the responses immediately
generate a risk score and preliminary asset allocation. The advisor discusses this with
the client, aligning it with the client’s goals and constraints (which the survey captured).
Together, they form the IPS which both parties sign. This IPS then guides how the

portfolio is managed going forward, with the risk tolerance survey forming the backbone
of the IPS’s risk section. Because of the rigorous design and validation, both client and
advisor can trust that the risk level set in the IPS is appropriate and backed by science,
regulation, and the client’s own inputs.

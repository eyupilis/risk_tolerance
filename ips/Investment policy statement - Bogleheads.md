Investment policy statement
An Investment policy statement (IPS) is a statement that defines your general investment
goals and objectives. It describes the strategies that you will use to meet these objectives, and
contains specific information on  subjects such  as asset allocation, risk  tolerance, and  liquidity
requirements.
## [note 1]
Alternatively, you could consider using a simpler investing plan (see below):
If you find creating a full Investment Policy Statement too complex
If your investment objectives do not justify the effort needed to create an Investment Policy
## Statement
Every investor could potentially benefit from having an investment policy statement. It provides
the foundation for all your future investment decisions. It serves as a guidepost, identifies goals
and creates a systematic review process. The IPS aims to keep you focused on your objectives
during short-term swings in  the  market, and  gives you  a  baseline from which to  monitor
investment performance of your overall portfolio, as well as the performance of individual fund
managers.
If you are using some sort of financial advisor, an IPS outlines the ground rules of the relationship
between you and that advisor. And you can use the IPS as a reference to see whether or not your
portfolio is achieving your stated goals and objectives. You can also use your IPS to evaluate and
review any proposed changes to your investments against your overall objectives.
A properly constructed Investment Policy Statement supports following a well-conceived, long-
term investment discipline, rather than  one  that  is  based on  false  overconfidence or  panic in
reaction to short-term market fluctuations.
Someone without a written policy often bases decisions on day-to-day events, which regularly leads
to chasing short-term performance that may hinder them in reaching long-term goals. Having a
policy encourages you to maintain focus on the long-term nature of investing, especially during
turbulent or exuberant times.

accounts?

Example IPS
## Investment
objectives:
These are my main objectives for my investment program. I have developed them after a review
of my financial resources, financial goals, asset allocation, risk tolerance and time horizon.
Objective 1: To retire at the age of 57
Objective 2: To have an annual income from my investments of at least $45,000 after taxes
and in today’s dollars (inflation assumed to be 3.0 percent yearly)
Objective 3: To leave a meaningful inheritance for my children
Objective 4: To minimize potential tax liabilities
Objective 5: To monitor portfolio allocation against holding limits, to benchmark returns
against expectations, and to consider revisions to portfolio as personal situation may dictate
## Risk
tolerance:
My ability to tolerate the uncertainties, complexities and volatility inherent in the investment
markets has been considered in the development of this investment program. The main factors
that have influenced my risk tolerance and asset allocation are: age, present financial condition,
specific financial goals, discretionary income and its variability, past investment experience.
## Holding
limits:
My portfolio was developed subject to certain holding limitations. These are limitations on the
minimum and maximum percentage investment in each asset class:
Large Cap U.S. Equities (15-30 percent)
Mid Cap U.S. Equities (10-25 percent)
Small Cap U.S. Equities (5-15 percent)
Foreign Equities (5-15 percent)
REITs (0-15 percent)
Inter-Term Govt Bonds (10-25 percent)
Corporate Bonds (0-10 percent)
Cash and Cash Equivalents (5-20 percent)
## Target
allocation:
Based on my financial resources, financial goals, time horizon, tax status, holding limitations, risk
tolerance and expected investment performance a recommended portfolio was determined. The
portfolio balances risk and reward and attempts to achieve the stated objectives of the
investment program. The initial asset allocation is:
Large Cap U.S. Equities (25 percent)
Mid Cap U.S. Equities (10 percent)
Small Cap U.S. Equities (5 percent)
Foreign Equities (15 percent)
REITs (10 percent)
Inter-Term Govt Bonds (25 percent)
Corporate Bonds (5 percent)
Cash Equivalents (5 percent)
## Selection
criteria:
Investment portfolios used to implement the investment program shall be subject to specified
selection criteria and shall be monitored for adherence to my investment policy guidelines, major
changes in the portfolios and comparative performance with similar investments. The expense
ratio and overall cost of funds shall be a major point in the selection criteria. To minimize style
drift, index funds are preferred, if available, for all asset class.
## Review
process:
My investment performance will be monitored and reported on a quarterly basis and will be
compared against the appropriate benchmarks. The investment program will be reviewed at least
annually to make sure that it continues to achieve his stated objectives. Since this investment
program is long-term in nature, the periodic adjustments made to his investment program should
be small.
Rebalancing:The percentage weighting to each asset class within the investment portfolio will vary. The
percentage weighting within each asset class will be allowed to vary within a reasonable range of
plus or minus an absolute 5 percent or 25 percent of the original allocation amount; whichever is
triggered first. To minimize taxable events when rebalancing is required, dividends and net cash

inflows will be used to meet the strategic asset allocation targets. If cash flow is not sufficient to
meet the target allocation for an asset class, I will decide whether to effect transactions in order
to rebalance the asset allocation.
Fellow Boglehead Sunny (https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile
&u=681) was one of the first to post a popular IPS. It may not cover all of the topics necessary for
someone with  a  complicated financial situation, but  his  IPS  is  brilliant in  its  elegance and
compactness.

philosophy:
"Buy-and-hold, long-term, all-market-index strategies, implemented at rock-bottom cost, are
the surest of all routes to the accumulation of wealth" - John C. Bogle
Asset allocation:
Maintain overall 60% stock + 40% fixed-income allocation until home purchase to
accommodate both short-term and long-term requirements. Assets should be diversified
across major asset classes including domestic equity, international equity (20-25% of
equities), conventional bonds of short to intermediate term, and TIPS (50% of fixed).
Funds and
accounts:
Use low cost mutual funds - index funds preferably - which do not overlap and provide
maximum diversification across asset classes. Try to assume only market risk as far as
possible. Try to shelter tax-inefficient funds in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax drag.
Target allocation:
VTSMX - Total Stock Market Fund 45% - Taxable account
VGTSX - Total Int'l Market Fund 15% - Roth IRA
VIPSX - TIPS Fund 20% - Traditional IRA
IIBAX - Intermediate Bond Fund 20% - 401k
VMMXX - Money Market fund (6 months' expenses) - Taxable account
## Other
considerations:
Automate future contributions wherever possible. Rebalance yearly. No market timing. Exact
sub-allocations are not as important as maintaining the overall 60/40 stock/fixed allocation -
no need to make things complex in order to meet sub-allocation targets.

In some cases, a formal investing policy statement may seem too complicated or inconvenient. In
that case, you could develop an informal investing plan (also referred to as an investment plan)
instead. Whether it is called a policy or a plan, the idea is that you have a clear understanding of
managing your investment goals and objectives.

The Bogleheads forum often gets questions such as "I have $50K saved up and I need to know
which funds to put it in!". Setting up an investing plan will help answer these questions.
An investing plan can be as easy as following these simple steps:

Step 1 - Formulate your goals. Be as specific as possible, realizing that you will make changes
as the years go by.
Step 2 - Set up a plan for each goal. The plan consists of identifying what type of account you
will use to save the money, choosing the amount you will put toward the goal each year,
working out an asset allocation likely to reach the goal with the minimum risk necessary, and
identifying a plan B for the goal in case the returns you are planning on do not materialize.
Step 3 - Select the best (usually lowest cost) investments to fulfill your desired asset allocation.
Using all or mostly index funds further simplifies the process.
Some typical goals that can benefit from an investing plan:
I want $40,000 for home downpayment by June 30, 2030
I want to have enough money to pay the tuition at my alma mater in 13 years when my 5 year
old turns 18
I want to have $2 million saved for retirement by Jan 1 2050

For institutions, high-net-worth individuals and family offices, developing an
investment policy statement that reflects their goals and objectives is
increasingly important for long-term investing success.
## Suzanne Lindquist
Head of Endowments and Foundations for OCIO
The past two decades have included three recessions and major market
downturns, out of which arose a more complex institutional investment
and regulatory landscape. Amid this increasingly challenging market
environment, institutional and high net worth clients—including
foundations, endowments, pensions and family offices—continue to
demand higher standards from their advisors. A comprehensive and

coherent investment policy statement can be key to meeting those
demands and establishing productive working relationships.
A well-crafted investment policy statement may prove even more
essential today than in previous environments, given recent periods of
remarkable market volatility and anticipated lower investment returns
over the market cycle. Stocks, as measured by the S&P 500 Index,
compounded annually at 14.7% between March 2009 and July 2022. But
over the next 20 years, U.S. equities are anticipated to return an average
of 8.4% a year, according to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s
forecasts.
What Is an Investment Policy Statement?
An investment policy statement describes a client’s financial goals and
investment objectives, while documenting the roles and responsibilities
of all parties involved in managing portfolios, including the client’s
outsourced chief investment office (OCIO), board members, investment
committee, investment managers and custodian.
Written by the OCIO with their client, the statement should provide a
framework for the management of client assets, putting rails in place
that enhance a client’s ability to achieve its financial targets. It includes
specific objectives, benchmarks, asset allocation guidelines and any
security or sector-related restrictions or requirements. Plus, it should
describe more fundamental intentions that align with the mission of the
client. The process of developing an IPS also serves as an opportunity for
the OCIO to set and manage expectations around market outlook and the
impact of that outlook on the client’s short-term and long-term
investment goals.
Once created, an investment policy statement can help contextualize the
client’s spending outlook. Ultimately, the document enables OCIOs to
provide a full suite of investment management, fiduciary oversight and
operations/ administrative services, allowing clients to focus on bigger-
picture items.

Creating a Living Document
The investment policy statement acts as the central point of reference
between the client and the OCIO through each stage of the ongoing
investment lifecycle. While certain portions like the setup and structure
are static and evergreen, the primary components of the IPS—sections on
client discovery, asset allocation, portfolio construction, and governance
—should be dynamic.
This means that both the client and the OCIO should have an
understanding that certain aspects of the statement will evolve over
time, given changing market environments and expectations as well as
shifting client needs and constraints. These shifts may include changes
in the client’s cash flows and spending policies.
For example, a client may come to the OCIO with what it thinks are
achievable goals. But the OCIO may find, and help the client realize, that to
attain those goals, certain criteria—such as investment objectives, asset
allocation guidelines, benchmarking and manager selection guidelines—
may require adjustments.
While the investment policy statement is a living document, investment
policies and guidelines should not change frequently. For example, short-
term changes in the markets should not require an adjustment to the
document.
Creating a Solid Foundation
One important benefit of a well-crafted investment policy statement is
that it can help preserve the relationship between institutions when there
is turnover among the individuals involved. Consider a client’s board of
directors, whose membership changes every few years. The document
can act as a guide, helping new individuals quickly get up to speed on
investment policies.
By laying out the various responsibilities of each entity with fiduciary
responsibilities, the investment policy statement establishes clear
guidelines for a client’s risk-taking comfort zone and ensures that

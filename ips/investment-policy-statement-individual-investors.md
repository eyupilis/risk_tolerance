## INTRODUCTION
Providing investment counsel to individuals requires addressing a variety of priorities and
concerns  in  addition  to  addressing  the  absolute  bottom  line  of  investment  performance.
The investment strategy must be considered in the context of the client’s overall financial
plan, short- and long-term objectives, risk tolerance, and preferences. The potential com-
plexity associated with taking all of these factors into account in an investment strategy
requires a disciplined approach.
The  investment  policy  statement  (IPS)  serves  as  a  strategic  guide  to  the  planning
and implementation of an investment program. When implemented successfully, the
IPS  anticipates  issues  related  to  governance  of  the  investment  program,  planning
for  appropriate  asset  allocation,  implementing  an  investment  program  with  internal
and/or external managers, monitoring the results, risk management, and appropriate
reporting.  The  IPS  also  establishes  accountability  for  the  various  entities  that  may
work  on  behalf  of  an  investor.  Perhaps  most  importantly,  the  IPS  serves  as  a  policy
guide  that  can  offer  an  objective  course  of  action  to  be  followed  during  periods  of
market disruption when emotional or instinctive responses might otherwise motivate
less prudent actions.
The  IPS  is  a  highly  customized  document  that  is  uniquely  tailored  to  the  preferences,
attitudes, and situation of each investor. Templates that purport to offer convenience and
ease in development of an IPS almost inevitably sacrifice consideration of factors that are
highly relevant to the investor. The investment professional must thoroughly understand
the  investor’s  objectives,  restrictions,  tolerances,  and  preferences  to  be  able  to  develop  a
truly useful policy guide.
“Elements  of  an  Investment  Policy  Statement  for  Individual  Investors”  suggests  desir-
able components of an IPS for a high-net-worth or individual investor. Not every element
will be appropriate for every investor or every situation, and other components reflecting
unique investor circumstances may be desirable for inclusion.
An  investor  with  a  current  IPS  may  choose  to  evaluate  that  IPS  in  relation  to  these
elements,  and  those  embarking  on  development  of  a  new  IPS  may  choose  to  consider
focusing on the elements discussed here.

## WWW.CFAINSTITUTE.ORG2
Elements of an Investment Policy Statement for Individual Investors
For  each  element,  an  example  of  IPS  language  is  presented  that  may  be  relevant  to  an
individual investor. The examples are entirely fictitious and are provided to suggest how
components might be documented. For an example to reflect appropriate language for a
particular  investor  would  be  an  improbable  coincidence.  Rather,  the  most  relevant  and
useful  language  should  be  developed  in  consultation  between  the  investment  counselor
and the client.

-      Scope and Purpose
1a.      Define the context.
A  preamble  is  often  useful  to  relate  information  about  the  investor  and/or
the source of wealth as a way of establishing the context in which an invest-
ment program will be implemented.
## ■
Example: “The assets of the Leveaux Family Trusts trace back to the estab-
lishment of Leveaux Vintners in 1902 by Claude Leveaux. Over the course
of  the  next  77  years,  three  generations  of  the  Leveaux  family  worked  to
build  the  family  business,  LVX  Industries,  to  include  distilled  spirits,
gourmet snack foods, and the LVX chain of cafes in Europe and Canada.
Each business line was grounded in the philosophy of delivering outstand-
ing quality and value to consumers as well as investing in the communities
in which Leveaux did business. In 1979, LVX Industries was purchased by
the  British  conglomerate  FoodCo  for  the  equivalent  of  US$272  million.
Michelle Leveaux established the Leveaux Foundation with $100 million
of the sale proceeds, and much of the remainder constituted the Leveaux
Family Trusts, which are the subject of this Investment Policy Statement.”
1b.      Define the investor.
Define who the investor is, be it a natural person or legal/corporate entity.
## ■
Example: “This Investment Policy Statement governs the personal invest-
ment portfolios of Mr. Chen Guangping.”
Specify which of the investors’ assets are to be governed by the IPS.
## ■
Example:  “Investment  portfolios  governed  by  this  Investment  Policy
Statement include all portfolios established in Jorge Castillo’s name, port-
folios established in his name with joint rights of survivorship with Maria
Castillo,  charitable  remainder  trusts  established  by  Jorge  Castillo,  and
Uniform  Gifts  To  Minors  Accounts  established  for  the  benefit  of  Jorge
Castillo, Jr., and Cynthia Castillo.”

## WWW.CFAINSTITUTE.ORG4
Elements of an Investment Policy Statement for Individual Investors
1c.      Define the structure.
Set forth key responsibilities and actors.
## ■
Example:  “Janice  Jones,  as  financial  adviser  to  Sam  and  Mary  Smith,  is
responsible  for  coordinating  updates  to  the  Investment  Policy,  including
soliciting  input  from  the  designated  tax  and  legal  advisers  to  Sam  and
Mary  Smith.  Ms.  Jones  is  also  responsible  for  monitoring  application  of
the Investment Policy Statement and shall promptly notify Sam and Mary
Smith of the need for updates to the Policy and/or violations of the Policy
in implementation. Sam and Mary Smith shall be responsible for approv-
ing the Investment Policy Statement and all subsequent revisions to it.”
Set  forth  a  “standard  of  care”  for  those  serving  as  advisers.  Regulations  in
different  jurisdictions  may  allow  advisers  to  abide  by  different  standards  that
depend on their preferences, business models, and client preferences. Fiduciary
standards  generally  require  that  advisers  always  consider  client  interests  fore-
most, whereas suitability standards require recommendations that are suitable
for  an  investor  based  on  the  adviser’s  knowledge  of  that  investor’s  circum-
stances.  Investors  may  not  perceive  or  understand  the  distinction  unless  the
issue is addressed in the IPS.
## ■
Example: “Fuji Advisors acts as a fiduciary in its capacity as adviser to the
Takesumi Family Accounts and acknowledges that all advice and decisions
rendered must reflect first and foremost the best interests of its clients. Fuji
Advisors also affirms its compliance as a firm with the CFA Institute Asset
Manager Code of Professional Conduct.”
Identify an organizational structure for investing.
## ■
Example: “The trustees of the Wei Family Trust shall designate an invest-
ment adviser who shall have exclusive discretionary authority to invest on
behalf of the Trust consistent with the policies set forth in the Investment
Policy  Statement,  except  that  the  portfolio  established  at  ZZZ  Trust
Company  identified  as  “Wei  Trust  Discretionary  Portfolio  1”  shall  be
managed exclusively by Mr. Wei Zhang.”

## 5
Scope and Purpose
## © 2010 CFA INSTITUTE. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
Identify a risk management structure applicable to investing.
## ■
Example:  “Susan  Smith,  as  investment  adviser  to  Russell  Roberts,  is
responsible for monitoring investment risks and reporting them to Russell
Roberts in the reporting format that has been agreed to, a sample of which
is presented in Appendix XX.”
Assign responsibility for monitoring and reporting.
## ■
Example:  “The  HHH  Trust  Company  will  provide  custody  services  and
is  responsible  for  rendering  a  monthly  financial  report  for  the  Devereaux
Trust. The HHH Trust Company report shall be considered to be the offi-
cial record for the Trust accounts and shall be the basis for the risk review
to be performed by Judith Jones as adviser to the Trust.”
Document acceptance of the IPS.
## ■
Example:  “By  their  signatures  below,  the  Xien  Trust  trustees  and  LLL
Investment  Counsel  acknowledge  both  receipt  of  this  document  and
acceptance of its content.”

## WWW.CFAINSTITUTE.ORG6
## 2.    Governance
2a.    Specify who is responsible for determining
investment policy, executing investment
policy, and monitoring the results of
implementation of the policy.
The  IPS  documents  accountability  for  all  stages  of  investment  policy  development  and
implementation. It can reinforce the obligations of advisers to offer counsel and the obli-
gations of principals to ultimately approve or disapprove of the policy.
## ■
Example: “As trustee for the Charitable Remainder Trust, Nigel Brown is responsible
for approval of the investment policy and any subsequent changes to it. In their capac-
ity  as  counselors  to  the  Trust,  Tower  Capital  shall  counsel  the  trustee  as  to  devel-
opment  of  the  Investment  Policy,  suggest  appropriate  revisions  to  the  Policy  on  an
ongoing  basis,  and  monitor  and  report  results  achieved  through  implementation  of
the Policy on no less than a monthly basis.”
2b.    Describe the process for reviewing and
updating the IPS.
A  process  for  refreshing  the  IPS  as  investor  circumstances  and/or  market  conditions
change should be clearly identified in advance.
## ■
Example: “Wanda Wood is responsible for monitoring the investing requirements of
Sam and Susan Smith as well as monitoring investment and economic issues, and Ms.
Wood is responsible for suggesting changes to the IPS as necessary. Ms. Wood shall
review the IPS with Sam and Susan Smith no less frequently than annually.”

2c.    Describe responsibility for engaging and
discharging external advisers.
The IPS should set forth who is responsible for hiring and firing external money manag-
ers, consultants, or other vendors associated with the investment assets.
## ■
Example:  “Marcel  Perrold  delegates  exclusive  authority  to  his  financial  adviser,
Francois  Finault,  to  retain  and  dismiss  individuals  and/or  firms  to  manage  Mr.
Perrold’s  investment  assets.  Francois  Finault  shall,  prior  to  hiring  any  external
investment manager, disclose in writing to Mr. Perrold any compensation or other
consideration received or due to be received from the external investment manager.”
2d.    Assign responsibility for determination of
asset allocation, including inputs used and
criteria for development of input assumptions.
An  asset  allocation  framework  provides  strategic  context  for  many  tactical  investment
decisions. Asset allocation policies are likely to change over time as characteristics of the
investor change and as market circumstances vary. Accordingly, the IPS might include an
asset allocation policy statement as an appendix, which can be revised without requiring
approval of an entirely new IPS. The IPS, however, should address the assumptions used
in developing and selecting inputs to the asset allocation decision process.
## ■
Example:  “At  least  annually,  Tower  Capital  shall  review  the  asset  allocation  of  the
Family  Investment  Accounts  and  suggest  revisions  for  final  approval  by  James  and
Jennifer  Jensen.  The  asset  allocation  plan  is  incorporated  as  Appendix  A  to  this
Investment Policy Statement. It shall consider the proportions of investments in cash
equivalents,  municipal  securities,  U.S.  fixed-income  obligations,  U.S.  large-capital-
ization equities, U.S. small-capitalization equities, and American Depositary Receipts
(ADRs). Tower Capital shall consider expected returns and correlations of returns for
a broad representation of asset classes in the U.S. capital markets and consider antici-
pated changes in the rate of inflation and changes in marginal tax rates.”

## WWW.CFAINSTITUTE.ORG8
Elements of an Investment Policy Statement for Individual Investors
2e.    Assign responsibility for risk management,
monitoring, and reporting.
The IPS should document who is responsible for setting risk policy, monitoring the risk
profile of the investment portfolio, and reporting on portfolio risk.
## ■
Example:  “As  investment  adviser,  Tower  Capital  is  responsible  for  using  the  state-
ments  prepared  by  CCC  Brokerage  as  a  basis  for  evaluating  that  the  risk  profile  of
the Jorge Luiz account is consistent with the risk management policies approved and
adopted  by  Jorge  Luiz  (see  Appendix  ZZZ).  Tower  Capital  shall  be  responsible  for
identifying variances in risk positions that exceed tolerable limits as specified in the
risk management policies and shall take prompt corrective action. No less than quar-
terly, Tower Capital shall provide to Jorge Luiz a reporting of the all such variances in
the prior quarter.”

-    Investment, Return, and Risk
## Objectives
3a.    Describe the overall investment objective.
The  IPS  should  relate  the  purpose  of  the  assets  being  invested  to  one  or  more  broad
investment objectives.
## ■
Example: “The investment program governed by the IPS is intended to supplement
the  earned  income  of  Marcel  Perrold  in  satisfying  ongoing  living  expenses  and  to
provide funds upon his retirement in 2016.”
3b.    State the return, distribution, and risk
requirements.
State the overall investment performance objective. Careful specification of
the  overall  investment  performance  objective  is  likely  to  incorporate  descrip-
tions of general funding needs and the relationships of those needs to key fac-
tors (e.g., inflation, a spending rate).
## ■
Example:  “The  financial  plan  developed  for  Margarita  Mendez  in  2007
indicates a required real growth rate of 4 percent to satisfy her future obli-
gations and allow her to retire in 2017 as planned.”
Identify performance objectives for each asset class eligible for investment.
The  IPS  should  set  forth  all  permissible  asset  classes  in  which  the  portfolio
may  be  invested.  Some  investors  may  benefit  from  using  techniques  to  risk-
adjust  the  asset  class’s  benchmark  return  and  portfolio  return  for  purposes
of  comparison.  Note  that,  although  some  asset  classes  may  not  be  used  at  all
times,  they  should  still  be  identified  in  the  IPS.  For  each  asset  class,  a  brief
description of the class should be provided and a benchmark for performance
should be identified. Within each asset class, subordinate asset classes may be
listed  (for  example,  U.S.  large-cap  equity  may  be  a  subclass  of  U.S.  equity).

## WWW.CFAINSTITUTE.ORG10
Elements of an Investment Policy Statement for Individual Investors
Descriptions  and  benchmarks  for  subclasses  may  be  identified  in  the  IPS  or
reserved for an asset allocation plan that may be attached as an appendix.
## ■
Example:  “The  Family  Trust  accounts  may  invest  in  U.S.  equity,  U.S.
fixed-income,  U.S.  money  market,  and  international  developed-market
equity  securities.  The  following  benchmarks  have  been  selected  for  com-
parison with each asset class: U.S. equity, Russell 3000 Index; U.S. fixed
income,  Barclays  Capital  U.S.  Aggregate  Index;  U.S.  money  market,
Lipper  U.S.  Government  Money  Market  Funds  Average;  international
developed-market  equity  securities,  MSCI  Europe/Australasia/Far  East
(EAFE) Index.
Define  distribution/spending  assumptions  or  policies.  Spending  or  distribu-
tions  from  the  portfolio  should  be  defined.  Often,  a  “spending  calculus”  that
reconciles  investment  return  objectives,  fees,  taxes,  inflation,  and  anticipated
spending is useful as a guide to realistic assumptions. Distributions may be char-
acterized as a percentage of portfolio market value or as a specific cash value.
## ■
Example:  “Based  on  the  overall  expected  portfolio  return  of  7.5  percent,
fees of 1.2 percent, inflation of 2.8 percent, and an effective tax rate of 32
percent  of  total  appreciation,  the  Linzer  Trust  Portfolio  may  support  an
annual  spending  rate  of  1.2  percent  of  the  portfolio  market  value  while
retaining potential for capital preservation or nominal growth.”
Define a policy portfolio to serve as a basis for performance and risk assess-
ments.  An  asset  allocation  policy  should  designate  target  allocations  to  each
asset class, with allowable ranges around the targets. Similar targets and ranges
may  be  specified  for  subclasses.  Overall  fund  returns,  weighted  according  to
strategic  target  allocations,  may  be  constructed  and  compared  with  overall
actual  fund  performance.  Similarly,  some  insight  as  to  risk  exposures  may  be
developed from examining deviations from target allocations and violations of
acceptable ranges of deviation.
## ■
Example:  “An  asset  allocation  plan  for  the  Mendez  Charitable  Trust  is
attached  as  Exhibit  ZZZ,  and  it  shall  be  subject  to  periodic  review  and
change  under  the  sole  authority  of  Jose  Carrios  as  trustee.  For  each  asset
class,  a  target  allocation  has  been  established  that  reflects  the  optimized
asset  allocation  study  conducted  by  Hill  Counsel  as  investment  advis-
ers;  also  established  are  allowable  ranges  within  which  actual  allocations
to  each  asset  class  may  vary.  The  investment  adviser  is  responsible  for

## 11
Investment, Return, and Risk Objectives

adhering to the asset allocation plan and for maintaining actual allocations
to asset classes within the ranges established. Each quarterly report by the
investment manager to the trustee shall confirm actual asset allocations as
of the end of the quarter and shall also confirm that allocations during the
quarter were within allowable ranges.”
3c.    Define the risk tolerance of the investor.
The  IPS  should  describe  the  investor’s  general  philosophy  regarding  tolerance  for  risk.
The IPS should acknowledge that the portfolio will be subject to the assumption of risk,
and  have  the  potential  for  returns  associated  with  risk  to  be  both  positive  and  negative
over  time.  Relevant  risks  are  usually  myriad  and  may  include  liquidity,  legal,  political,
regulatory,  longevity,  mortality,  business,  and/or  health  risks.  In  addition  to  specifying
relevant  risks,  defining  acceptable  paths  of  risk  may  also  be  important.  For  example,  in
light of possible personal risks (i.e., loss of job, disability, life-cycle stage), “volatility” as a
descriptive measure of risk may be irrelevant beyond an absolute level of loss that would
completely derail an investment portfolio.
For individuals, assessing risk tolerance may be difficult and subjective. Where possible,
the  IPS  should  account  for  known  liabilities  to  lend  some  quantitative  basis  to  the  risk
tolerance  assessment.  Individual  investors  may  also  require  an  assessment  of  their  intel-
lectual and emotional tolerance for potential losses associated with risks; for these assess-
ments, interviews or questionnaires can be used. More nuanced approaches may attempt
to define multiple levels of risk associated with avoiding financial catastrophe, maintain-
ing  a  current  standard  of  living,  meeting  a  specific  future  financial  goal,  or  developing
significant further wealth. The results of this sort of analysis may suggest boundaries for
tolerance  for  risk  and  associated  policies  (for  example,  stop-loss  or  rebalancing  policies.)
Such policies may be incorporated in an appendix.
## ■
Example: “James and Jennifer Jensen understand that the very nature of risk is uncer-
tainty about the future—specifically, uncertainty as to future investment returns. The
Jensens seek to generate investment returns that are proportional to the risks assumed
in the Family Trust portfolios. Tower Capital, as investment adviser, seeks to imple-
ment an investment strategy that balances the need to build the Family Trust assets as
stated in the objectives identified in the 2009 Financial Plan with the risks associated
with that strategy. Based on the 12 April 2009 Risk Assessment interview with James
and Jennifer Jensen, Tower Capital understands that an absolute loss in any 12-month
period of more than 33 percent is intolerable. At that threshold, therefore, policies and
procedures to minimize risk of further loss should be implemented by Tower Capital.”

## WWW.CFAINSTITUTE.ORG12
Elements of an Investment Policy Statement for Individual Investors
3d.    Describe relevant constraints.
Investors must address a variety of constraints that affect their investment programs. Such
constraints  may  reflect  legal  or  regulatory  imperatives  or  internal  policies.  Often,  such
constraints are closely linked to particular risks that are relevant to the investor.
Define  an  evaluation  horizon  for  achievement  of  performance  objectives.
Although relatively short time periods may be used for monitoring performance,
establishing a minimum time horizon for achievement of performance objectives
clarifies when action may be needed to resolve underperformance issues.
## ■
Example: “The investment adviser will provide the Family Trust trustees
with  a  quarterly  report  that  summarizes  the  performance  of  each  invest-
ment  manager,  each  asset  class,  and  the  Family  Trust  in  its  entirety.
Although  such  quarterly  reports  are  essential  for  monitoring  purposes,
evaluation of relative success in achieving investment objectives will be on
a rolling eight-quarter basis.”
Identify  any  requirements  for  maintaining  liquidity.  Investors  may  have
short-  or  medium-term  needs  for  cash  that  should  be  specified  in  the  IPS  if
they are ongoing requirements.
## ■
Example:  “All  dividend  and  interest  income  will  be  transferred  to  the
James Jensen checking account at the end of each month. In addition, up
to  15  percent  of  the  market  value  of  the  portfolio  should  be  invested  in
such a way that it can be liquidated upon five days’ notice without suffering
capital depreciation.”
Identify  to  what  extent,  if  any,  tax  considerations  will  affect  investment
decision  making.  In  some  instances,  the  tax  consequences  of  an  investment
decision may significantly change the desirability of the proposed transaction.
The investor’s general tax situation and specific tax issues should be accounted
for in the IPS.
## ■
Example:  “In  general,  the  investment  policy  will  be  for  the  Wen  portfo-
lios to invest for appreciation in the taxable individual accounts and invest
for dividend and interest income in the individual retirement accounts. In
addition, the investment adviser shall consider tax-loss harvesting of exist-
ing  high-basis  holdings  as  transactionsin  similar  industries  or  sectors  are

## 13
Investment, Return, and Risk Objectives

considered, secondary to the primary investment objective of the purchase/
sale decision.”
Identify any relevant legal constraints.
## ■
Example: “Management of the Aquilla Family Foundation account is sub-
ject to the provisions of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act.”
Specify any policies related to leverage. The ability to leverage portfolios may
be  constrained  by  policy  or  a  relevant  statute.  Any  such  constraint  should  be
identified in the IPS. In addition, to the extent that different manager portfo-
lios and/or different asset classes have different leverage allowances, account-
ability for monitoring overall leverage should be defined.
## ■
Example: “At the discretion of Tower Capital as investment manager, the
Xie Weng portfolio may be margined up to 50 percent of its value.”
Identify  any  restrictions  on  investment  in  foreign  securities  or  invest-
ments. Some  investors  choose  to  limit  their  exposure  to  investments  out-
side  their  home  country  because  of  economic  or  investment  reasons;  others
choose to impose constraints on such investments to manage administrative
burdens and costs.
## ■
Example: “Investments in issuers of securities that are not denominated in
yen and/or are not traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange shall be limited
to those available by participation in commingled trusts that are custodied
domestically and denominated in yen.”
If relevant, specify a policy on foreign currency management. If investments
in  foreign  assets  are  permissible,  the  IPS  should  address  management  of  for-
eign cur renc y.
## ■
Example:  “To  the  extent  that  payments  of  interest,  dividends,  or  princi-
pal occur in any currency other than the Canadian dollar, the investment
adviser will be responsible for arranging conversion of the foreign currency
to Canadian dollars immediately upon receipt at the prevailing spot rates.”

## WWW.CFAINSTITUTE.ORG14
Elements of an Investment Policy Statement for Individual Investors
3e.    Describe other considerations relevant to
investment strategy.
State  the  investment  philosophy.  The  IPS  should  document  the  investor’s
philosophical  approach  to  investing,  which  may  include  such  dimensions  as
market efficiency; the degree of opportunism anticipated; and so on.
## ■
Example: “James and Jennifer Jensen have as a philosophical basis for
investment the conviction that many segments of domestic equity mar-
kets are efficient and thus active management of such assets is unlikely
to add value net of investment costs beyond the short term. James and
Jennifer  Jensen  believe  that  some  equity  market  segments  (including
global equity markets of stocks with market capitalizations of less than
US$250 million) are relatively inefficient and that active management
strategies  may  be  applied  profitably  in  these  segments.  Furthermore,
James  and  Jennifer  Jensen  believe  in  a  long-term  orientation  for  their
investment  program  and  do  not  intend  to  seek  to  exploit  investment
opportunities that may exist in the very short term because they believe
they cannot profitably do so consistently.”
Identify  a  proxy-voting  policy.  The  ability  to  exert  shareowner  rights  may
contribute to the value of investments. A policy for establishing responsibility
and  processes  for  proxy  voting  should  be  specified  in  the  IPS,  although  the
detailed policy may be reserved for an appendix. Generally, the adviser and/or
the investor will retain responsibility for proxy-voting decisions, but other par-
ties (such as brokers, custodian banks, or consultants) may also have roles that
should be acknowledged in the IPS.
## ■
Example: “Tower Capital, as investment adviser to the Family Trust, shall
be responsible for voting all proxies in a timely manner in a way that maxi-
mizes  the  value  of  the  Trust’s  underlying  investments.  Upon  timely  noti-
fication  to  Tower  Capital,  the  Family  Trust  trustees  may  provide  voting
instructions to be executed.”
Identify   constraints   on   participation   in   securities   lending   programs.
Securities lending programs offer investors incremental income on their port-
folios.  Participation  in  such  programs  does  create  some  degree  of  collateral
investment  and  counterparty  risk,  however,  and  a  policy  should  be  set  forth
governing participation.

## 15
Investment, Return, and Risk Objectives

## ■
Example: “Except for the margin account established at GGG Securities,
no  Charitable  Remainder  Trust  securities  shall  be  lent  or  otherwise
hypothecated or pledged as collateral.”
Identify  special  factors  to  be  used  in  including  or  excluding  potential
investments  from  the  portfolio.  Investors  may  choose  to  impose  limits  on
certain investments because they believe extra-financial factors affect security
prices, they desire to avoid concentrated risks in a particular industry, or they
wish to follow a philosophical or political orientation. In particular, attention
to Environmental, Social, or Governance ESG factors to screen investments is
increasingly common. Islamic clients may choose to restrict investment activity
to Shariah-compliant investments. The use of ESG or other criteria should be
explicitly allowed or disallowed in the IPS.
## ■
Example:  “Consistent  with  her  personal  beliefs,  Jennifer  Jensen  requires
that no investments be made for her account in companies that derive rev-
enue  from  products  or  services  that  are  contrary  to  the  teachings  of  the
Catholic Church. The investment adviser shall be responsible for reviewing
the portfolio monthly to assure that this requirement is satisfied and shall
immediately  dispose  of  any  portfolio  holding  found  to  be  in  violation  of
this policy.”

## 4.    Risk  Management
4a.    Establish performance measurement and
reporting accountabilities.
The  IPS  should  establish  an  objective,  reliable  mechanism  for  reporting  investment
performance.
## ■
Example:  “Hill  Counsel,  as  investment  adviser  to  the  Charitable  Remainder
Trust,  shall  calculate  the  performance  of  each  investment  account  under  its
supervision  and  report  performance  to  the  trustees  by  the  15th  day  of  the  new
quarter. Calculations shall be consistent with the Global Investment Performance
Standards  published  by  CFA  Institute.  Hill  Counsel  shall  also  provide  a  recon-
ciliation  of  the  firm’s  records  with  the  brokerage  statement  provided  by  CCC
Brokerage as part of the performance report.”
4b.    Specify appropriate metrics for risk
measurement and evaluation.
Consistent use of metrics to assess and evaluate the risk profile of investment portfolios is
important for meaningful comparisons to be made over time. Inappropriate use of differ-
ent  metrics  to  highlight  or  disguise  certain  risks  should  be  avoided.  There  is  reasonable
debate over the suitability of various metrics, however, so continued review of the metrics
being used and metrics that are available is recommended.
## ■
Example:  “In  addition  to  performance  reporting,  Tower  Capital  shall  report  to  the
Marcel Family Trust trustees on a quarterly basis the following risk metrics: (1) risk
calculated  as  the  annualized  standard  deviation  of  portfolio  returns  relative  to  each
portfolio’s specified benchmark and (2) the information ratio for each portfolio based
on annualized returns for the portfolio and benchmark as of the end of each quarter.”

4c.    Define the process for rebalancing portfolios to
target allocations.
Outside boundaries of acceptable variations from targets (or some other target rebalancing
point) should be documented in the IPS. The rebalancing mechanism may be integrated
with the risk management system, in which case, a brief description in a separate appen-
dix of the rebalancing policy with reference to the risk management process is appropri-
ate. If the policy is not to rebalance, this policy should be documented in the IPS.
## ■
Example:  “On  the  first  business  day  of  each  new  quarter,  the  investment  adviser
for  the  Jensen  personal  accounts  shall  propose  rebalancing  transactions  to  return
the  accounts  to  their  target  allocations  and  shall  execute  these  transactions  within
two  business  days  of  receiving  authorization  from  the  Jensen  Family  Investment
Committee, except that if the principal value of a proposed rebalancing transaction is
less than $50,000, that rebalancing transaction shall be deferred indefinitely.”

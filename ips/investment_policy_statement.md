## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This Executive Summary is not intended to replace, and must be read in conjunction with, the Investment Policy
Statement (the “Policy”). In the event of a conflict between the Executive Summary and the Policy, the Policy
shall govern. Capitalized terms have the meanings assigned to them in the Policy.
## Introduction /
## Background
The Board has the primary fiduciary responsibility for investing TRS trust assets in
accordance with Article XVI, Section 67 of the Texas Constitution and with applicable
law. The Board establishes investment objectives and policy. The Board also monitors
the actions of the Investment Division to ensure compliance with its policies. The
Board and Investment Division are assisted by outside Advisors, Consultants and
internal and external legal counsel.
See “Section 1.3 – Roles of Board, Staff, Advisors, and Consultants.”
The Investment Policy Statement provides a formal plan for investing pension trust
fund (the “Trust”) and health insurance program assets. The Policy defines the roles
and responsibilities of the Investment Division and other parties granted and approved
by the Board.
## Objectives
The Trust’s objectives are to (a) control risk and (b) achieve a long-term rate of return
that exceeds (i) the assumed actuarial rate of return adopted by the Board, (ii) inflation
plus 5% and (ii) the Trust’s Policy Benchmark. The Trust is subject to a “prudent
person” standard of care under the Texas Constitution.
Authority and Key
## Restrictions
The Board assigns implementation authority to the Investment Division and as such
the Investment Division has created a committee to oversee and implement Board-
approved investment policy. The Internal Investment Committee’s (the “IIC”)
authority is limited by the size of the investments it can approve without also
obtaining approval from the Board. The Chief Investment Officer (the “CIO”) has
Special Investment Opportunity authority of up to $1 billion.
See “Appendix B – IIC Approval Authority and Manager Organization Allocation
## Limits.”
## Asset Allocation
Each broad asset class category outlined below provides a distinct and purposeful role
within the Total Fund. The Board sets these asset class targets based on periodic asset
allocation and asset/liability studies while seeking to achieve the Trust’s stated
objectives.
## Broad Asset Class Category
## Target   Min   Max
## Global Equity 57% 50% 64%
## Stable Value 21% 14% 28%
## Real Return 21% 14% 28%
## Risk Parity 5% 0% 10%
## Net Asset Allocation Leverage -4%
Total                                                                        100%
In addition to the target for each broad asset class category target, there are specific
targets for subcategories with minimum and maximum ranges that are +/-5% around
the target allocation, with certain exceptions.
See “Section 1.6 – Total Fund Asset Mix and Benchmarks.”
Investment Policy Statement, Page 4 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025

















Measurement and
## Reporting
Investment performance, peer performance, policy compliance, asset allocation,
external investments activities, derivatives usage, risk limits, liquidity, leverage,
private markets strategy, staffing, board and board observer seats, use of placement
agents, and other information will be monitored and reported to the Board.
See “Section 1.7 – Total Fund Measurement and Reporting Criteria.”
## Risk Management
The Investment Division will monitor and manage risk of the Total Fund Portfolio and
report to the Board on a periodic basis. Key risks include, but are not limited to:
Market Risk, Foreign Exchange Risk, Credit and Counterparty Risk, Leverage,
Liquidity, and Tracking Error.
See “Article 10 – Risk Management and Oversight.”
## Tracking Error
Neutral tracking error targets are established for certain portfolios of the Trust:
Neutral                                                                         Max
Equity (US) 300
Equity (International; Non-US, EAFE) 300
Equity (International; Emerging Markets) 300
Equity (All Country) 300
## Stable Value Hedge Funds 400
## Risk Parity 400
## Government Bonds – Nominal 300
## Government Bonds - Real 300
## Total Public Fund 100 300
See “Appendix A – Tracking Error Neutral (in annualized basis points).”

## TOTAL FUND AND PORTFOLIO DESIGN
## 1.1 Introduction
The Teacher Retirement System of Texas (“TRS”) administers a pension trust fund and other health insurance
programs for retirees and certain active public education employees under State of Texas constitutional and
statutory provisions. TRS is governed by a Board of Trustees (the “Board”). TRS provides service and disability
retirement benefits and death and survivor benefits for Texas public education employees and their
beneficiaries. Benefits are funded by state and member contributions and investment returns.
## 1.2
Purpose and Design
The purpose of this Investment Policy Statement (this “Policy”) is to provide a formal plan for investing pension
trust fund and health insurance program assets to achieve defined investment objectives consistent with the TRS
mission statement adopted by the Board and with applicable law.
This Policy also defines the roles and responsibilities of the various entities involved in the investment process
and facilitates internal and external communication of investment policy.
The appendices to this Policy are incorporated into and form part of this Policy for all purposes.
Terms that are not defined within the body of this Policy have the meanings assigned to them in the
“Definitions” at the end of this Policy.
Other policies relevant to this Policy and its subject matter include the Code of Ethics for Contractors, Employee
Ethics Policy, Trustee Ethics Policy, Personal Trading Policy, Commission Credits Policy, Confidentiality
Policy, Information Security Policy, Proxy Voting Policy, and Securities Lending Policy.
## 1.3
Roles of Board, Staff, Advisors, and Consultants
The Board has the primary fiduciary responsibility for investing TRS trust assets in accordance with Article
XVI, Section 67 of the Texas Constitution and with applicable law. The Board establishes investment objectives
and policy, obtains expert advice and assistance, and oversees the employment of a qualified and competent
investment staff (the “Investment Division”) and Legal and Compliance. The Board also monitors the actions of
staff to ensure compliance with its policies. The Board’s standing committees are charged with those
responsibilities set forth in the bylaws of the Board. The Board and the Investment Division are assisted by
outside investment Advisors, Consultants and internal and external legal counsel.
a. The Board Investment Advisors (“Advisors”) are selected by the Board to provide education, advice,
commentary, and discussion as requested at Board meetings, assist with development and review of
investment policies and procedures, assist with the development of the strategic asset allocation, report
on the progress of the Fund in meeting its investment objectives, compare the performance of the
portfolio to established benchmarks, and perform additional duties as directed by the Board, such as due
diligence or analysis of a manager or investment. The Investment Division and Advisors provide
information as needed to assist the consulting actuary in performance of actuarial services.
b. The Investment Division has fiduciary responsibilities delegated by the Board under applicable law. The
Investment Division manages the Fund according to the Board’s policies, advises and informs the
Executive Director and the Board about investments, and recommends modifications to this Policy. The
Investment Division executes all transactions, performs risk-management functions, and prepares
investment reports.
Investment Policy Statement, Page 6 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025


















c. The Internal Investment Committee (the “IIC”) reviews, considers, and authorizes proposed investments
and external manager engagements as required by this Policy. Additionally, the IIC will manage the
currency hedge ratios (set forth in Appendix C) and review as needed.
A prudence or recommendation letter will be required in the following circumstances:
- When the Board considers authorizing an external investment opportunity because the allocation or
commitment exceeds the limits in Appendix B;
- When the CIO, Executive Director, or a Board member requests a letter for any external investment
opportunity presented to the IIC; or
- When an external investment opportunity presented to the IIC meets all three of the following
criteria:
i. The investment will reside in the principal investment Private Markets Portfolio;
ii. The initial allocation or commitment exceeds 0.25% of the Total Fund value; and
iii. The investment is the first by TRS with a manager organization.
If a Board member desires that any investment opportunity scheduled for consideration by the IIC be submitted
for Board consideration, the Board member should notify the Executive Director and the CIO sufficiently in
advance to permit completion of due diligence and consideration by the Board and the appropriate Board
committee, as applicable, before the anticipated closing date.
The permanent IIC membership consists of the CIO and the Chief Risk Officer (the “CRO”). There must be a
minimum of five members on the IIC and, in addition to the CIO, at least two members must be Investment
Division Senior Managing Directors (“SMDs”). The CIO will notify the Chair of the Investment Management
Committee in advance of any designation or removal of a SMD from the IIC. Termination of a member’s TRS
employment terminates IIC membership as of the date the employee or TRS gives notice of termination, as the
case may be. The Investment Division shall notify the Board and the Executive Director if there is any change to
the membership of the IIC. The IIC may delegate investment discretion to asset class investment committees
and will approve new internal actively managed investment strategies as established in IIC procedures and
guidelines.
The CIO will establish procedures and guidelines for the operations of the IIC. The IIC procedures and
guidelines may provide that the CIO may designate and remove select Directors as non-permanent voting
members to the IIC. The IIC procedures and guidelines will define a quorum and establish the vote required to
authorize an investment or external manager engagement or, if required by this Policy, recommend an
investment or external manager engagement to the Board, which vote may not be less than a majority of the
then-incumbent IIC members present and voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present. The CIO shall have
the power to veto any investment or delegation of investment discretion authorized or recommended by the IIC
pursuant to a vote of its members.
The Executive Director or a designee may attend any meeting of the IIC, and the Investment Division shall
deliver to the Executive Director copies of all IIC materials, analyses, correspondence, and agendas as and when
delivered to the IIC members or other TRS employees. The Executive Director is not a member of the IIC,
however, acting in his or her capacity as the chief executive officer and chief administrative employee of TRS as
set forth in the Board’s bylaws, the Executive Director shall, after consultation with the CIO, have the power to
veto any investment or delegation of investment discretion proposed for IIC consideration or authorized or
recommended by the IIC pursuant to a vote of its members whenever he or she deems such veto to be in TRS’
best interest.
When this Policy requires that the Board authorize an investment or an engagement of an external manager, the
IIC shall vote on whether to recommend such investment or engagement to the Board. The results of the vote
shall be reported to the Board in the materials provided to the Board for consideration.
d. All proposed changes to this Policy will be reviewed by Legal and Compliance for compliance with
state and federal laws regarding fiduciary responsibility, investment prudence, regulatory compliance,
Investment Policy Statement, Page 7 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025


















ethics compliance, and other applicable standards or requirements before submission to the Governance
Committee. Except as authorized by the Executive Director, proposed changes to this Policy will first be
presented to the Governance Committee, which will consider recommending the proposed changes to
the Board. The Board may consider and adopt proposed changes that have not been considered by the
Governance Committee. This Policy shall be reviewed at least once every three years.
e. The Investment Division is authorized to engage qualified Consultants on an as-needed basis to assist
the Investment Division with respect to investment opportunities and to provide other investment due
diligence, analysis and advice.
## 1.4
## Total Fund Objectives
In this Policy, the total investment portfolio includes all assets invested by TRS to provide retirement, death,
health, and disability benefits administered by the system, including cash and cash equivalents (the “Total Fund”
or the “Fund”) and will be structured and managed to achieve the following objectives:
a. Control risk through proper diversification of asset classes and by establishing long-term risk and return
expectations; and
b. As applicable to the pension plan, achieve a long-term rate of return that:
i. Exceeds the assumed actuarial rate of return adopted by the Board;
ii. Exceeds the long-term rate of inflation by an annualized 5%; and
iii. Exceeds the return of the Fund Policy Benchmark.
## 1.5
## Total Fund Investment Standard
Article XVI, Section 67(a)(3) of the Texas Constitution and Section 825.301, Texas Government Code, states
that the standard of care for TRS investments is a “prudent person” standard. Section 825.301, Texas
Government Code, provides that Section 117.004(b), Property Code, applies to TRS investment decisions.
Section 117.004(b) generally states that the determination of the prudence of a single investment decision will
be made taking into consideration the investment of all of the assets of the trust, or the assets of the collective
investment vehicle, as the case may be, rather than a consideration as to the prudence of the single investment of
the trust, or the single investment of the collective investment vehicle, as the case may be.
Environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors influence the performance of TRS’ investments. In
making investment decisions, the Investment Division will consider ESG factors that are material to long-term
returns and levels of risk. Materiality of specific ESG factors vary across strategies, companies, sectors,
geographies, and asset classes.
All investments must be made prudently and in accordance with fiduciary and ethical standards, without
promoting interests unrelated to the portfolio’s stated objectives of controlling risk and achieving a long-term
rate of return.
All investments made by the Total Fund must be in “securities” as provided by Article XVI, Section 67 (a)(3) of
the Texas Constitution and defined in Texas Government Code Section 825.301.
The Investment Division may engage External Managers to provide discretionary investment management
services under Investment Management Agreements (“IMAs”) as needed.
## 1.6
Total Fund Asset Mix and Benchmarks
The Investment Division will assist the Board in engaging in an asset-liability study for the pension plan at least
once every five years to review asset classes, return-risk assumptions, and correlation of returns with applicable
benchmarks and across asset classes. A key objective of the asset-liability study shall be the development
Investment Policy Statement, Page 8 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025








through statistical modeling techniques of a diversified portfolio that specifies ranges of prudent portfolio
exposures and a “long-term target” position for each asset class. The normal portfolio mix will represent the
portfolio that is expected to meet the Board's actuarial return objectives for the pension plan within the risk
tolerances specified herein.
Each asset class allocation percentage has a “long-term target” position within the overall portfolio and a
maximum and minimum range around that target allocation. All percentages refer to market value.
Each asset class is described by an associated benchmark that describes, in general terms, the opportunity set
and return characteristics associated with the asset class. For certain private or more complex asset classes the
benchmark serves as a proxy for expected returns rather than an approximation of the actual investments that
will characterize that component of the portfolio. Those benchmarks, along with the allocation ranges, are
identified in the table on the following page, and are referred to as the Policy Benchmarks.
The ultimate expression of risk tolerance by the Board to the Investment Division is the selection of the strategic
asset allocation targets, permissible allocation ranges around those targets, and tracking error limits.

With respect to the maximum range and minimum range, the CIO may increase any maximum range by 5% or decrease
any minimum range by 5% (but may not decrease a minimum range below zero) if the CIO concludes in a writing delivered
to the Executive Director and to the Board of Trustees stating the action taken and the reasons why the CIO believes that
such increase or decrease would be in the best interests of TRS; provided, the maximum range for Total Global Equity may
not be increased above 68%. Before taking action, the CIO must request comments from the Chair of the appropriate Board
committee and TRS Advisors. The Board, at the next succeeding Board meeting, must authorize the increase or decrease if
the CIO proposes that the changes continue in effect after such Board meeting. The CIO will notify the Chief Compliance
Officer of any such change to a maximum or minimum range. If the Board does not authorize the continuation of the
change to a maximum or minimum range after the next succeeding Board meeting, the Investment Division shall use best
efforts to rebalance the portfolio to bring the asset classes within the ranges in the table above within 90 days.
## 2
To calculate the Total Fund benchmark, the benchmark weight of each of Private Equity, Real Estate, and Energy,
Natural Resources, and Infrastructure, will be set each quarter as the ending actual weight from the prior quarter. Any
difference in the calculated Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure benchmark
weights from the target benchmark weights will be offset using other asset classes with 55% of such difference applied to
All Country, 7% to Non- US Developed, 1% to Emerging Markets, 7% to Stable Value Hedge Funds, 7% to Risk Parity,
14% to Government Bonds – Nominal and 9% to Government Bonds - Real.
The Investment Division does not normally manage the allocations to Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy, Natural
Resources, and Infrastructure on a tactical basis and will use its best efforts to achieve the Target allocation for these assets
classes; provided, with notification to and comment sought from the Chair of the appropriate Board committee, the
Investment Division may seek to achieve a higher or lower Target so long as such Target is within the Minimum Range and
the Maximum Range.
## 3
Allocation to USA and Emerging Markets may only be negative if offset by allocations within the All Country asset
class.
## 4
Benchmarks will be adjusted for transitions authorized by Policy and for securities TRS is not authorized to own or buy
because of this Policy or statutory provisions for which no fiduciary exemption has been exercised and have the Bloomberg
Tickers of NU757432, GU722807, NU722808, and NU722809.
## 5
The Customized State Street Private Equity Index is composed of the quarterly reported SSPEI, one quarter lagged and
adjusted for the most recent quarter-end currency spot prices. Quarterly returns are geometrically linked for longer return
horizons. The benchmark is adjusted in each quarter to remove any index constituents which did not provide a valuation
statement as of the time of publication. The benchmark will exclude funds with size of $1 billion or less and will be
adjusted to match the vintage year of the Private Equity Portfolio commingled fund commitments.
## 6
Absolute Return is a broad category that includes all assets that have a high probability of generating a positive absolute
return regardless of market conditions over a one- to three-year period.
## 7
“Asset Allocation Leverage” reflects any excess allocation to the combined cash and investment exposures that is greater
than 100%. Asset Allocation Leverage does not include Strategy Leverage. “Strategy Leverage” is leverage used within an
asset class to achieve similar return-risk characteristics as the benchmark.
## 8
The benchmark will be compounded daily using SOFRRATE index with a one-day lag, Actual/360, and Modified
Following day count conventions.
## 9
The Maximum Range for the Private Equity Asset Class will change to 17% and the Minimum Range for the All Country
Asset Class will change to 34% on October 1, 2027.
1.7 Total Fund Measurement and Reporting Criteria
The Investment Division will deliver reports to the Board (and the appropriate Board committee, as applicable)
adequate to indicate whether the Total Fund is meeting its objectives and that will permit the Board to monitor
each portfolio for compliance with this Policy. The Board will establish performance and risk measurement and
attribution standards for the Total Fund, each asset class, and component portfolios.
Investment Policy Statement, Page 11 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025























The following comparisons and reviews will be performed quarterly (unless otherwise noted) and presented to
the Board:
a. Investment Performance – Investment performance for the Total Fund and each component portfolio, net
of external management fees (if applicable), will be compared with their respective benchmark indices.
Fund performance will be judged primarily by comparisons to long-term (three, five, and ten year) Policy
Benchmark returns.
b. Monitoring of compliance with Policy – Portfolios will be reviewed for compliance with the requirements
set forth in this Policy. The Chief Compliance Officer will have overall responsibility for compliance
monitoring. However, if considered necessary, TRS will hire external parties to obtain assistance regarding
compliance monitoring. To ensure independence in compliance monitoring, the Chief Compliance Officer
or external parties hired will not be given the authority to trade securities. To ensure ongoing compliance
with this Policy and completeness of disclosures to the Board regarding compliance, the Chief Compliance
Officer has authority to require certifications from applicable IIC members or Managing Directors

## 1.8
Total Fund Portfolio Implementation and Design; Restrictions
a. The Total Fund investment portfolio is characterized by the following functional portfolios that are charged
with the implementation of day-to-day portfolio investment and management activity:
i. Public Markets Portfolios;
ii. Private Markets Portfolios; and
iii. Overlay Portfolios;
The objectives, authority and limitations of each of these portfolios, and the authorized uses of derivatives, are
described throughout the remainder of this Policy.
b. In no event shall the aggregate allocation to External Managers pursuant to IMAs exceed 30% (or a different
percentage of not more than 50%, if a greater percentage is specified in the Texas Government Code) of the
Total Fund at the time of investment. For avoidance of doubt, this restriction does not apply to assets held
by funds (including Hedge Funds) which limit the liability of TRS to the capital contributed and any
distributions that TRS might be legally obligated to contribute or repay to the fund.
c. Subject to Appendix F, the Investment Division is authorized to represent TRS on:
i. Advisory committees or boards and as board observers in investments in which TRS has an investment
interest.
Investment Policy Statement, Page 13 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025





















ii. After evaluation of the net benefit to TRS, employees in the Investment Division are authorized to
represent TRS or to nominate or appoint third-party independent non-employees to represent TRS on
the governing body of a non-public (private) or a publicly-traded business entity in which TRS holds a
direct or indirect investment interest.
d. Except as required by fiduciary duties created by the Texas Constitution or applicable law, each TRS
investment portfolio, including separate account investments, will comply with prohibitions and restrictions
on investments imposed on TRS by state law.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Policy and its implementation
are subject to all applicable state, federal, and international laws where and to the extent that such laws are in
force.  The Board authorizes and requires compliance with such laws.  No further action by the Board will be
required to implement compliance with an applicable law.
e. The General Authority Resolution adopted by the Board designating those employees authorized to execute
documents and attached as Appendix D is incorporated in this Investment Policy. Should the Board
supersede such resolution, such superseding resolution shall be incorporated in this Investment Policy and
replace the superseded resolution as Appendix D as of the effective date of the superseding resolution.
## PUBLIC MARKETS PORTFOLIOS
## 2.1 Public Markets Portfolios Objectives
The objectives of the Public Markets Portfolios are to invest in publicly traded and Restricted Securities to meet
or exceed the performance of the relevant Policy Benchmarks or to manage the asset allocation and risk of the
Trust. The Public Markets Portfolios will employ a wide variety of investment and trading strategies with
varying levels of liquidity and leverage. It is expected that some strategies will involve more concentrated,
shorter term investments as well as those that are longer term in nature and thus will generally have more
tracking error, while other investments will have less correlation, beta, and volatility and thus will offset the
overall volatility of the Public Markets Portfolios and the Total Fund.
## 2.2
## Public Markets Portfolios Authorized Investments
The Public Markets Portfolios are authorized to invest in the following:
a. All securities in a Policy Benchmark, all securities that trade publicly (whether on an exchange or over the
counter) or pursuant to SEC Rule 144A, and securities issued in underwritten initial public offerings
(“IPOs”);
b. Fixed income securities, whether publicly traded or restricted;
c. Restricted Securities which are expected to become public or otherwise freely marketable within three years
after the initial investment date pursuant to registration or an exemption from registration;
d. Derivatives in accordance with Article 9;
e. Private Investment Funds including Hedge Funds; and
f. Cash and cash equivalents.
## 2.3
## Public Markets Portfolios Restrictions
a. Not more than 20% of the outstanding equity securities of a single class of any company may be purchased.
Securities which are deemed to be beneficially held by TRS for purposes of Section 13 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (including equity securities held in an IMA or a Private Fund in which TRS is
deemed to be the beneficial owner for purposes of Section 13), shall be counted against the 20% limit.
Investment Policy Statement, Page 14 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025























b. The Public Markets Portfolios shall conform to the tracking error targets prescribed in Appendix A.
c. The Public Markets Portfolios that are managed directly by the Investment Division may hold short
positions in securities listed in Section 2.2. The aggregate short positions exposure excluding derivatives of
the portfolios may not exceed 25% of the market value of the internal equity portfolios without the prior
written consent of the CIO. In no event may the aggregate short positions exposure of the internal equity
portfolios exceed 50% of the market value of the internal equity portfolios, nor may any short sale or
position violate the laws or rules of any jurisdiction or exchange in or on which the applicable securities are
traded or listed.
d. The market value of Restricted Securities purchased in Public Markets Portfolios pursuant to 2.2c will not
exceed 2% of the market value of the Total Fund at time of investment.
e. Not more than 15% of the Total Fund may be invested in Hedge Funds. Compliance with this limit is
determined at the time TRS executes the investment documents for each Hedge Fund investment or
additional investment.
## 2.4
## External Public Markets Portfolios
The External Public Markets Portfolios (the “EPM Portfolios”) are:
a. The External Manager Portfolio, which consists of:
i. Private Funds that are determined not to be Hedge Funds as defined by Section 2.5 of this Policy, and
ii. Separate accounts managed or advised by External Managers under an IMA with TRS.
b. The Hedge Fund Portfolio.
c. The Absolute Return Portfolio including credit sensitive investments.
## 2.5
## Hedge Fund Defined
In this Policy, “Hedge Fund” means a Private Investment Fund with the following general characteristics, as set
forth in Section 825.3012, Texas Government Code:
a. Is not registered as an investment company;
b. Issues securities only to accredited investors or qualified purchasers under an exemption from registration;
and
c. Engages primarily in strategic trading of securities and other financial instruments.
“Hedge Fund” includes a Private Investment Fund of funds or similar vehicle that itself invests in Hedge Funds.
An investment in a Hedge Fund does not involve a delegation of investment discretion to an External Manager
for purposes of the statutory limit on delegation to External Managers.
For the purposes of complying with Section 2.3(e), the Investment Division shall use the following criteria to
analyze and determine whether a Private Investment Fund is “primarily engaged in strategic trading” and should
be classified as a Hedge Fund:
Investment Policy Statement, Page 15 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025













































## Criteria
“Strategic Trading of Securities”
## Characteristics
Non-Hedge Fund
## Characteristics Potential
## Hedge Fund
- Variability in Asset Class
## Concentration
Asset allocation typically stays the
same throughout a market cycle, as
shown by historical practice
Unconstrained; asset class mix
can change dynamically in
response to market conditions or
as opportunities arise
- Beta to underlying index specified
for the particular mandate
Generally higher levels of beta (e.g.,
## 0.75+)
Often less beta (e.g., <0.75)
- Securities Traded Primarily publicly-traded securities Typically public or private
instruments, and often with some
illiquid (e.g., “side pockets”)
investments segregated for
accounting and incentive fee
purposes
- Leverage Gross leverage less than 250% and
net leverage 75% to 125%
Unconstrained by policy and
practice – managers often
unwilling to commit to
constraints
- Short sales of company-specific
securities (i.e., non-derivatives)
Typically <50% gross short
Shorting of company-specific
securities is integral to investment
strategy or process, with gross
short positions exceeding 50%
- Use of Derivatives
Limited use of derivatives (notional
value excluding derivatives used to
hedge currency risk is less than
100% of net asset value)
Derivatives are integral to
strategy or process (notional
value excluding derivatives used
to hedge currency risk is greater
than 100% of net asset value)
- Transparency Generally position-level
transparency for investor
Risk-level transparency, but little
or no position-level transparency
## 8. Liquidity
Limited use of lock-ups, short or
no notice period; frequent (e.g.,
monthly) or no redemption
windows
Often lock-ups, withdrawal fees,
notice periods exceeding 30 days
and/or less frequent redemption
windows than monthly; gates and
ability to suspend redemptions
can extend redemption for years
or frustrate liquidity goals
## 9. Performance Fees
May charge performance fees, but
often over asset class hurdle
Generally, manager charges
management and performance or
incentive fees, or both, but
usually with no asset class hurdle
In this Section 2.5:
Beta is a measure of an asset’s volatility in relation to a specific market or risk factor, as observed over a market
cycle; the measure of an asset’s risk in relation to the market (for example, the S&P500) or to an alternative
benchmark or factors. Generally, the return of a security with a beta of 1.5 will be, on average, 1.5 times the
market return.
Investment Policy Statement, Page 16 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025

















Leverage is a condition in which the net potential monetary exposure of an obligation exceeds the value of the
underlying assets supporting the obligation. Net Leverage is calculated as the difference between (A) the sum of
(i) the market value of all long cash market positions, (ii) the notional value of all long derivative positions, and
(B) the sum of (i) the absolute market value of all short cash market positions, and (ii) the absolute notional
value of all short derivative positions divided by (C) the net market value of the fund. Gross Leverage is the
total of (A) the sum of (i) the market value of all long cash market positions, (ii) the notional value of all long
derivative positions, (iii) the absolute market value of all short cash market positions, and (iv) the absolute
notional value of all short derivative positions divided by (B) the net market value of the fund. For option based
instruments, notional value may be calculated using hedge ratios to derive a delta-equivalent exposure.
Proposed investments in funds classified as Hedge Funds will be reported to the Board (and appropriate Board
committee, as applicable) quarterly. If the criteria examined do not clearly indicate, based on at least a
preponderance of criteria, how a fund should be classified, the Investment Division may elect to present the
pertinent information to the IIC for consideration of classification. Further, if the application of any one or more
of the criteria for leverage, short sales, and derivatives, standing alone, would classify the fund as a Hedge Fund,
but the preponderance of criteria would classify the fund as a non-Hedge Fund, the Investment Division may
either decline to authorize the investment or may elect to present the pertinent information to the IIC for
consideration of the classification of the fund and, if applicable, authorization for investment.
At time of consideration, the IIC will approve the allocation of each Hedge Fund to an asset class by reference
to factors such as investment strategy, underlying investments, correlation, beta, leverage, expected return and
expected risk. Generally, Hedge Funds in the Global Equity broad asset class category will be allocated to the
All Country asset class.
## 2.6
## External Public Markets Portfolio Authorization
a. Approval Authority – Hedge Fund, External Manager and Absolute Return Portfolios – The IIC is
hereby authorized to approve investments as defined and set forth in Appendix B of this Policy.
The Investment Division may authorize an allocation to an External Manager even if the manager will
invest a portion of the assets in a Private Investment Fund or funds or a tax-qualified collective trust
managed by an Affiliate of the External Manager, except that the Investment Division shall determine
whether any such fund should be classified as a Hedge Fund for purposes of Section 825.3012, Texas
## Government Code.
b. Short positions limit – The EPM Portfolios may hold short positions in securities authorized under Section
2.2. The aggregate short positions exposure of the External Manager Portfolio may not exceed 25% of the
market value of the External Manager Portfolio without the prior written consent of the CIO. In no event
may the aggregate short positions exposure of the External Manager Portfolio exceed 50% of the market
value of the External Manager Portfolio, nor may any short sale or position violate the laws or rules of any
jurisdiction or exchange in or on which the applicable Securities are traded or listed.
c. Allocation Adjustment Authority – Subject to the limits set forth in this Policy, the CIO, CRO, the heads
of Public Markets, EPM, or Special Opportunities may add to previously approved funds or investments for
the purposes of rebalancing, increasing allocations or adjusting risks. Such additional investments or
allocations shall not, on a monthly basis, exceed 2% of the Hedge Fund Portfolio, External Manager
Portfolio, or Absolute Return Portfolio (as appropriate) per investment.
d. Termination and Withdrawal Authority – The CIO, CRO, or the heads of Public Markets, EPM, or
Special Opportunities may transfer, sell, withdraw, or terminate interests in the Hedge Fund Portfolio,
External Manager Portfolio, or Absolute Return Portfolio, provided that the action does not breach the terms
and conditions of the applicable investment agreements.
Investment Policy Statement, Page 17 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025

















## 2.7
## External Public Markets Portfolio Restrictions
a. IMAs, considered in the aggregate, may not be used to circumvent the asset allocation parameters, risk
guidelines, or any other controls otherwise established by this Policy, including the provisions of Section
## 2.2.
b. The EPM Portfolios are subject to the size limitations in Section 1.8b.
c. Each IMA with an External Manager shall specify the applicable policies, risk controls, portfolio
characteristics, reporting requirements, requirements or restrictions, including criteria for determining
quality of investments or the use of standard debt-rating services.
## 2.8
External Public Markets Portfolio Conflicts of Interest
Conflicts of interest, including the appearance of conflicts, in the selection and engagement of external
investment managers will be avoided at all times. Potential or actual conflicts of interest must be evaluated
during due diligence and after engagement under applicable ethics policies and statutory provisions, including
without limitation Section 825.212, Texas Government Code, which does not apply to Hedge Fund managers in
that capacity. The Investment Division will develop guidelines and procedures to identify actual or potential
conflicts of interest affecting External Managers to be engaged pursuant to IMAs. The Investment Division shall
employ reasonable diligence to identify conflicts of interest affecting TRS trustees, employees, Advisors, and
Consultants with respect to all investments.
## 2.9
## Risk Parity Portfolios
Risk Parity is an asset allocation strategy that focuses upon equalizing the risk contributions of the asset classes
or risk factors comprising the portfolio. Risk Parity then uses leverage to scale the resulting portfolio to target a
stated level of portfolio risk or return comparable to typical pension fund unleveraged asset allocation strategies.
## PRIVATE MARKETS PORTFOLIOS
## 3.1 Private Markets Portfolios
The Private Markets Portfolios are (1) the Private Equity Portfolio (the “PE Portfolio”), (2) the Real Estate
Portfolio (the “RE Portfolio”) and (3) the Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure Portfolio (the “ENRI
## Portfolio”).
Private markets opportunities that will be considered for investment include the following: investments in
securities of any legally permissible investment vehicle, including title-holding entities that are wholly owned,
organized, and controlled by the retirement system, Private Investment Funds, co-investments, secondary
investments, externally managed separate accounts investing in securities, hybrid securities with characteristics
of equity or debt, joint ventures, secondary market transactions, entity-level investing or other off-market
investments, new and emerging managers, and opportunistic investments (e.g., investments in the management
entity of a private investment firm or sponsor, public-to-private transactions, and the acquisition of business
development company or investment trust assets).
## 3.2
## Private Markets Portfolios Authorization
The Private Markets Portfolios are authorized to invest in the asset classes specified in this Policy and may hold
and exercise rights, options and warrants attached to securities relating to an investment by the Private Markets
Portfolios. In furtherance of the investment activities of TRS, the Private Markets Portfolios are authorized to
Investment Policy Statement, Page 18 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025













engage with third parties and provide to them any required investment information for due diligence purposes so
long as the recipients have a duty of confidentiality as to the TRS information.
Funding of committed capital in Private Markets Portfolios will occur over an extended time period and may
take several years before the total allocation to each asset class is fully invested. Because an individual
investment may begin to return capital to the investor prior to the full funding of the investor’s commitment, the
outstanding invested capital of the investment might at times be substantially less than the total commitment. In
recognition of the above characteristics unique to the Private Markets Portfolios, a “committed” allocation to an
investment may exceed the respective allocation targets authorized. It will not be a violation of this Policy if
changes in the market values of the public assets portfolios or the Private Markets Portfolios cause the market
value of the Private Markets Portfolios to exceed the upper limit of the allocation ranges established in this
## Policy.
Investment Authority. The limits defined and set forth in Appendix B apply to allocations and commitments
by the Private Markets Portfolios.
Termination and Withdrawal Authority. The CIO or, as applicable, the heads of Private Markets, Private
Equity, Real Estate, or Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure may transfer, sell, withdraw, or terminate
interests in the Private Markets Portfolios in accordance with the investment documents, provided that the action
does not breach any agreement to which TRS is legally bound.
Commitment Authorization. Each investment must be authorized as required by the provisions, guidelines,
and limitations established in this Policy. Any structure in which TRS invests shall meet established legal
requirements.
Additional Allocation Authority. Subject to the limits set forth in this Policy, the CIO or, as applicable, the
heads of the Private Markets, Private Equity, Real Estate, or Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure
Portfolios may add funds to previously approved investments for the purposes of rebalancing, increasing
allocations or adjusting risks. Such additional investments or allocations shall not exceed, on a monthly basis,
2% of each of the Private Equity Portfolio, the Real Estate Portfolio, or the ENRI Portfolio (respectively, as
appropriate) per investment.
## PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO
## 4.1 Private Equity Portfolio Objectives
The PE Portfolio will be structured to achieve the following investment objectives:
a. The primary long-term objective is to develop a prudently diversified portfolio of investments that is
expected to enhance the overall risk-return profile of the Total Fund.
b. Provide competitive returns through capital appreciation.
The following attributes will be considered in constructing a diversified PE Portfolio: strategy, geography,
industry sectors, investment size, and vintage year.
## 4.2
## Private Equity Portfolio Authorized Investments
Private equity funds build portfolios of private investments in the equity or debt of operating companies. Private
equity funds may acquire investments in debt obligations, public or private common and preferred stocks,
convertible securities, and any warrants, rights, or options attached to any of the foregoing that relate to equity
ownership in an issuer. Privately-acquired securities usually have transfer restrictions and are not as liquid as
publicly-traded securities. Private equity funds are often classified by strategy, including: buyouts, credit,
special situations, and venture capital/growth equity.
Investment Policy Statement, Page 19 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025
















## 4.3
## Private Equity Portfolio Restrictions
The Private Equity Portfolio is authorized by and is subject to the terms and conditions described in Article 3.
## REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO
## 5.1 Real Estate Portfolio Objectives
The RE Portfolio will be structured to achieve the following investment objectives:
a. As the primary focus, contribute favorably to diversification of the Total Fund through exposure to real
estate’s low or negative correlation to the Public Markets Portfolios.
b. Provide competitive returns through capital appreciation.
The following attributes will be considered in constructing a diversified RE Portfolio: strategy, geography,
property types, size of investment, vintage year, and the number of funds or investment managers represented in
the portfolio. No specific geographic diversification or leverage targets are required.
## 5.2
## Real Estate Portfolio Authorized Investments
The RE Portfolio will focus on private or public real estate equity securities investments, including title-holding
entities that are wholly owned, organized, and controlled by the retirement system, private or public real estate
debt, real asset mezzanine debt or equity, mortgage-related investments, entity-level investments, private or
public real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), private or public master limited partnerships (“MLPs”), and other
opportunistic investments in real estate.
Real estate investments are often classified by strategy, including: core, core-plus, value-added, opportunistic,
and special situations.
## 5.3
## Real Estate Portfolio Restrictions
The RE Portfolio is authorized by and is subject to the terms and conditions described in Article 3.
## ENERGY, NATURAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE PORTFOLIO
6.1 Energy, Natural Resources and Infrastructure Portfolio
The ENRI Portfolio will be structured to achieve the following investment objectives:
a. Contribute favorably to diversification of the Total Fund by increasing exposure to assets with a higher
degree of inflation sensitivity.
b. Provide competitive returns through capital appreciation.
The following attributes will be considered in constructing a diversified ENRI Portfolio: general inflation
sensitivity, expected return, strategy, geography, resource exposure, size of investment, vintage year, where
investment is in the resources value chain (upstream, midstream, or downstream) or infrastructure type, and the
number of funds or investment managers represented in the portfolio. No specific geographic diversification or
leverage targets are required.
Investment Policy Statement, Page 20 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025












## 6.2
Energy Natural Resources and Infrastructure Portfolio Authorized Investments
The ENRI Portfolio may invest in private and public energy or natural resource or infrastructure related
securities either directly or through funds which may include investments in public or private equity, equity-
linked investments including options, warrants, preferred equity, and structured equity, private or public debt,
entity-level investments, master limited partnerships, commodity futures, natural resources interests (mineral,
royalty or working interests), timber and agricultural property, water, power generation, renewable energy, and
associated infrastructure, services, and technology. Energy and natural resource investments are often classified
by resource type and where the investment is in the resource value chain (upstream, midstream or downstream).
Infrastructure assets are classified as core, value-add, and opportunistic. Direct investments in physical
commodities are prohibited.
## 6.3
Energy, Natural Resources and Infrastructure Portfolio Restrictions
The ENRI Portfolio is authorized by and is subject to the terms and conditions described in Article 3.
## EMERGING MANAGERS PROGRAM
## 7.1 Emerging Manager Program
TRS shall make a good-faith effort to invest with qualified emerging managers for the External Public Markets
Portfolios and the Private Markets Portfolios. For the avoidance of doubt, these portfolios may also include
investments in energy, natural resources, and infrastructure. The Investment Division is authorized to invest
with qualified funds-of-funds managers skilled at identifying small and emerging managers in the private equity,
real asset and public equity markets. The Emerging Managers Program will target 1.1% of the market value of
the Total Fund.
Emerging managers can include, but are not limited to, minority, women, and disabled veteran-owned or -
controlled organizations. Conversely, not all minority, women, and disabled veteran-owned or -controlled
organizations are necessarily considered emerging managers for the purposes of this program. Whether a
management firm is an “emerging manager” depends on all of the facts and circumstances. In general, emerging
managers are defined as newer, independent private investment management firms that manage less than $3
billion or have a performance track record as a firm shorter than five years, or both.
The Investment Division may engage Emerging Managers Program Consultants without a requirement for
approval from the Board. In general, an emerging manager should be registered as an investment adviser with
the appropriate authorities if such registration would be consistent with industry practices or is required by law.
Each investment will have a minimum size of $5 million. With respect to the EPM Portfolio, the total
investment by TRS with each emerging manager may not exceed 40% of such emerging manager’s assets under
management at the time of IIC approval. With respect to the Private Equity Portfolio and the Real Estate
Portfolio, the total investment by TRS into each fund raised by an emerging manager may not exceed 40% of
the size of such fund at the time of IIC approval. This paragraph does not apply to investments executed as part
of a fund-of-funds mandate.
The Investment Division shall document its efforts to identify and expand its investments with qualified
emerging managers for the purpose of Board and legislative reporting on the methods and results, including data
disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and fund size. All investments under the Emerging Managers Program
must be made prudently and in accordance with fiduciary and ethical standards.
Investment Policy Statement, Page 21 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025






















## OVERLAY PORTFOLIOS
## 8.1 Overlay Portfolios Objectives
Overlay Portfolios are designed to manage risk, asset allocation, and market exposures through futures, options,
swap contracts, or forward agreements. Overlay Portfolios may be implemented in connection with the Total
Fund or with any investment or portfolio within the Total Fund.
## 8.2
## Overlay Portfolios Authorized Investments
Overlay Portfolios may contract for, buy, sell, and hold the following contracts and derivative instruments in
accordance with this Policy:
a. Exchange-traded futures contracts;
b. Options on exchange-traded futures contracts;
c. Over-the-counter or exchange-traded swap contracts;
d. Over-the-counter or exchange-traded option contracts; and
e. Forward contracts.
## 8.3
## Overlay Portfolios Restrictions
Overlay Portfolios may not be used to circumvent the asset allocation parameters, risk guidelines, or any other
controls or restrictions otherwise established by this Policy or applicable law.
When engaging in currency overlay strategies, the Overlay Portfolio may not increase or decrease the net
notional exposure of the Total Fund:
a. To all non-dollar currencies in aggregate by more than 5% of the market value of the Total Fund;
b. To any single developed market currency (except for the U.S. Dollar) by more than 2% of the market value
of the Total Fund; and
c. To any single emerging market currency by more than 1% of the market value of the Total Fund.
The foregoing percentage limit restrictions do not apply to currency derivatives used (i) as part of the non-
discretionary foreign exchange risk management policy described in Section 10.2, (ii) to settle security
transactions denominated in those foreign currencies and any authorized instrument or contract intended to
manage transaction or currency exchange risk in purchasing and selling investments, and (iii) for hedging the
characteristics of an individual investment to align it with the characteristics of such investment’s benchmark.
## AUTHORIZED USES OF DERIVATIVES
This Article enumerates the applications, documentation and limitations for the use of derivatives as permitted
under Section 825.301, Texas Government Code.
## 9.1 Derivatives Policy Scope
Except where specifically noted, this Policy applies to all derivatives transactions executed by the Investment
Division and by External Managers operating under an IMA. This Policy does not apply to registered or Private
Investment Funds issuing securities to TRS.
Investment Policy Statement, Page 22 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025












This Policy applies to all exchange-traded derivatives and over the counter (“OTC”) derivative instruments
authorized by law. This Policy does not apply to the use of derivatives by Private Investment Funds unless TRS
in fact controls and has a legal right to approve the investment policy or guidelines of such funds.
9.2 Derivatives Use by External Managers and Private Investment Funds (Hedge Funds)
The Total Fund may have external exposure to derivatives in two ways.
a. First, the Total Fund will invest as a passive investor in Hedge Funds organized as limited-liability entities,
which limits potential losses to the capital contributed to the entity. TRS is not a party to the management
agreement between the Hedge Fund and its investment manager. Hedge Fund and other fund managers owe
the same legal duties to all investors.
i. The Investment Division must exercise thorough due diligence in assessing the scope of the Hedge Fund
manager’s uses of derivatives, their purpose, experience of the fund manager’s staff in managing these
positions, inherent leverage, and the manager’s systems, controls and operations in determining
suitability of these entities for TRS investment.
b. Second, TRS may delegate discretion, through IMAs, to External Managers who act as a TRS agent with
respect to Total Fund assets and who are authorized to enter into specified contracts and commitments that
will be legally binding on TRS. External Managers are TRS fiduciaries.
i. For External Managers engaged pursuant to IMAs, Investment Division must view the External
Manager as an extension of the internal Investment Division’s investment management processes and
must require External Managers to comply with this Policy and applicable guidelines and law on the use
of derivatives to the same extent as the Investment Division. Guidelines for the scope and use of
derivatives will be established on a case-by-case basis with each External Manager in the applicable
IMA. An External Manager of publicly-traded investments engaged by TRS under an IMA may engage
in derivatives transactions only if expressly authorized by, and the transactions are consistent with, the
overall investment objectives and restrictions established in the IMA, this Policy, and applicable law.
Each IMA must be consistent with applicable law, this Policy, and other TRS policies. An IMA may
only authorize such uses of derivative instruments when the Investment Division reasonably concludes
after due diligence that the External Manager possesses the experience, expertise, and qualifications to
prudently use derivatives, and has appropriate operational, compliance, and risk management personnel,
policies, and procedures to effectively monitor and control their use, including the use of leverage.
ii. Selection, engagement, and monitoring of External Managers engaged through an IMA requires a clear
understanding of the managers’ uses of derivatives, particularly as it relates to various risk controls,
compliance functions, and leverage. The Investment Division will monitor risk exposures and leverage
on both an individual entity and aggregate basis. The permitted uses of derivatives and leverage by each
External Manager must be fully documented in each IMA.
## 9.3 Derivatives Definition; Authorization
Derivatives are financial instruments the value of which are derived, in whole or part, from the value of any one
or more underlying securities or assets, or index of securities or assets (such as bonds, stocks, financial
commodities, and currencies). For the purposes of this Policy, derivatives include, without limitation, futures
contracts; options; options on futures contracts; forward contracts; swap agreements, including swap contracts
with embedded options; any instrument or contract intended to manage transaction or currency exchange risk in
purchasing, selling, or holding investments; and any other instrument commonly used by institutional investors
to manage institutional investment portfolios. Derivatives, for purposes of this policy, do not include currency
forwards with a tenor of 30 days or less if such forwards do not require upfront amounts to be paid or received.
Derivatives may be exchange traded or OTC. Exchange traded derivatives are listed and traded on a national
exchange. Fulfillment of the contract is generally guaranteed by the exchange on which the instruments are
Investment Policy Statement, Page 23 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025

















traded. OTC derivatives are negotiated transactions between a buyer and a counterparty, which may result in
non-standard terms.
OTC derivatives between internal portfolios are authorized and subject to all procedures, controls, and reporting
required by this Policy unless denoted otherwise.  Internal OTC trades shall be made prudently and in
accordance with fiduciary and ethical standards and may not be used to circumvent the asset allocation
parameters, risk guidelines, or any other controls or restrictions otherwise established by this Policy or
applicable law.
## 9.4 Derivatives Applications Permitted
Consistent with the objectives set out in Section 9.1, derivative applications may be used by the Investment
Division and External Managers engaged through IMAs to:
a. Implement investment strategies in a lower cost and efficient manner;
b. Efficiently manage the Total Fund portfolio by altering the portfolio’s market (systematic) exposure in lieu
of trading the underlying cash market securities through purchases or short sales, or both, of appropriate
derivatives;
c. Construct portfolios with risk and return characteristics that could not be efficiently created with cash
market securities consistently with the objectives in this Policy and in compliance with applicable law;
d. Hedge and control risks so that the Total Fund’s risk-return profile is more closely aligned with the Total
Fund’s targeted risk-return profile through purchases or short sales, or both, of appropriate derivatives; and
e. Facilitate transition trading when holdings must be rebalanced or reallocated among permissible investments
as a result of changes to applicable benchmark indexes or policy changes.
f. External Managers may not engage in derivative applications that are inconsistent with the applicable IMA,
this Policy and applicable law, unless specifically authorized by the TRS Board and the IMA has been
amended accordingly.
## 9.5 Derivatives Applications Not Permitted
a. Derivatives may not be used for speculation. Derivatives are considered speculative if their uses have no
material relation to objectives and strategies specified by this Policy or any related policies or resolutions of
the Board. Derivatives may not be used for circumventing limitations or restrictions imposed by this Policy
or applicable regulatory requirements. Derivative applications may only be used to invest in asset classes
that are consistent with TRS’ legally permissible policy asset categories (including currencies),
implementation strategies, and risk-return characteristics.
b. Investments in derivatives underlain by physical commodities are prohibited unless such derivatives can be
cash- settled whether by contract terms, by rolling the position, or by trading out of the position before a
delivery obligation can arise. Standing orders or instructions for rolling or trading out of positions may be
used to prevent delivery obligations from arising under commodities derivatives contracts.
9.6 Derivatives Documentation and Controls
Prior to the implementation of a new internal derivative instrument type or application, the Investment Division
shall document the purpose, justification, baseline portfolio, derivative application portfolio, risks (including, at
a minimum, market, modeling, pricing, liquidity, and legal risks), the expected increase or reduction in
systematic and idiosyncratic risk resulting from the application, the amount of leverage employed under the
strategy, the prudent reasons for employing leverage, and the procedures in place to monitor and manage the
derivative exposure. The documentation will be approved by the CIO and reported to the IIC and the Board (or
appropriate Board committee, as applicable) at their next regularly scheduled quarterly meetings. The
Investment Policy Statement, Page 24 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025









Investment Division shall adopt fully documented control procedures to properly account for and value the Total
Fund’s exposure to each derivatives application, whether internal or external under an IMA. The Investment
Division shall establish an appropriate risk management procedure to monitor compliance both internally and by
External Managers and will take corrective action if necessary. The Investment Division shall have due regard
for operational risks associated with various derivatives strategies, including risk management, accounting
systems, liquidity needs, adequate staffing, and staff qualifications.
## 9.7 Derivatives Limitations
Counterparty Risks: In order to limit the financial risks associated with derivative applications, guidelines for
rigorous counterparty selection criteria and ISDA agreements shall be created by the Investment Division to
reduce counterparty risk for OTC derivatives. Any external counterparty in an OTC derivative transaction with
TRS must have a credit rating (which may be a counterparty risk assessment or rating) of at least A- (Standard
& Poor’s or Fitch) or A3 (Moody’s). All external OTC derivative transactions, including those managed through
IMAs, must be subject to established ISDA Master Agreements or, if centrally cleared, clearing agreements and
have full documentation of all legal obligations of both parties to each transaction. All ISDA Master
Agreements entered into by or on behalf of TRS by the Investment Division or an External Manager engaged
pursuant to an IMA (if applicable) shall provide for netting of obligations. The Investment Division and
External Managers may also use collateral arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit or performance risk.
The net market value of all OTC derivative positions, including those managed through IMAs, less collateral
posted, for any individual counterparty may not exceed $500 million. The net market value of all OTC
derivative positions for any individual counterparty, without consideration of collateral, may not exceed 5% of
the total market value of the Fund. If these market-value limits are exceeded, the Investment Division will
inform the CIO, Executive Director, and Chair of the appropriate Board committee as soon as practicable and
take appropriate corrective action within a 90-day period or develop a corrective action plan that will be
presented to the Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting at which investment matters will be discussed
following the initial 90-day corrective action period.
Global Risk Limitations: Notwithstanding other limitations in this Policy, transactions that would cause the
aggregate risk exposure of the Total Fund, including externally-managed portfolios, to exceed the aggregate risk
limits established by the current asset allocation policies of the Board are not permitted. On a Total Fund basis,
the combined economic exposure introduced through both cash and derivative market positions is subject to the
asset allocation ranges, risk limits, and other portfolio parameters described in this Policy.
Position Limits: For futures and options positions TRS will comply with all position and aggregate limits
established by the applicable regulatory and legal organizations and authorities within each jurisdiction.
9.8 Derivatives Risk Management and Compliance
To ensure compliance with this Article 9, all internally and externally managed derivatives (other than
derivatives held in Hedge Funds) must be marked to market on a daily basis by the Fund’s external custodian(s),
and such daily reports will be reviewed for accuracy by the TRS Risk Management staff and Investment
Operations personnel.
Compliance with the requirements of this Policy will be monitored by the Chief Compliance Officer using
information systems and data from internal and external sources. Any violations of this Article 9 will be
reported immediately to the Executive Director and to the CIO, who will determine, if considered material as
determined by Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Investment Officer, and Executive Director, the appropriate
remedy and report promptly to the Board (and the appropriate Board committee, as applicable).
Investment Policy Statement, Page 25 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025















## RISK MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT
## 10.1 Market Risk Management
The Investment Division will establish a framework for measuring enterprise-level risk for both the Total Fund
Portfolio and the established benchmark, including any transition benchmarks employed during asset allocation
shifts. At a minimum, this framework must include a quantified estimate of downside risk (e.g., value-at-risk
(“VaR”), estimated shortfall, or various parametric and non-parametric statistics). The Investment Division will
monitor the relative positioning of the Total Fund Portfolio vis-à-vis the benchmark no less frequently than
monthly.
a. Asset allocation limits – In addition to the Total Fund Portfolio level risk limits, the portfolio will be
constrained to the asset allocation percentages and ranges prescribed by this Policy. Accordingly, the total
exposure to each asset class must be based on the individual exposures of each cash security and each
outstanding derivative contract. The foregoing does not apply to those accounts designated as using strategy
leverage to better align the investment with the characteristics of the policy benchmark.
b. Risk limit – The Investment Division will model and monitor the Total Fund Portfolio and benchmark to
ensure that the total estimated risk for the Public Markets portion of the Portfolio is within the upper and
lower bounds corresponding to the maximum and minimum downside risk measures that could be achieved
through the asset allocation limits in this Policy.
c. Proxy securities and indices – If necessary and prudent, the Investment Division will employ proxies to
approximate the economic characteristics of actual investments if the terms and conditions of the actual
investments or the underlying holdings are not readily available or where the complexity of the underlying
investment renders a deterministic model impractical.
d. Private market assets holdings – The Investment Division may include private investments in this analysis
either by proxy or by actually modeling the terms and conditions of the underlying exposures; however, if
the inclusion of these investments is deemed to distort the true risk characteristics of the portfolio, the Board
may approve the use of an alternative methodology for analyzing the risk characteristics of those
investments.
e. Active risk limits – In addition to the portfolio-level risk statistics described above, a target tracking error
will be imposed on each public asset class mandate. Additionally, a target tracking error will be imposed on
the entire public portfolio that takes into account both internally and externally managed portfolios and
Private Funds as well as both asset allocation and security selection decisions. These limits are specified in
## Appendix A.
10.2 Foreign-Exchange Risk Management
The objective of the Foreign-Exchange (“F/X”) policy is to effectively manage portfolio return volatility
associated with foreign currency risk. F/X risk is the possibility of a negative currency return as a result of
adverse movements in foreign exchange rates. The F/X policy sets forth a structure and implementation plan to
determine the level of strategic currency risk that the Fund is willing to tolerate.
Currency hedge ratios will be separately applied to the Fund’s public-markets and private-markets non-dollar
exposures. Each currency hedge ratio is the percentage of aggregate, non-dollar currency exposure to be
passively hedged. The hedging horizon is intermediate (one to three years). The results of the currency hedge
ratio decisions will be presented to the Board (or the appropriate Board committee, as applicable) for approval
by the Board and incorporated into the benchmark as prescribed in Appendix C.
From an implementation perspective, an F/X overlay manager would have responsibility for implementing the
currency hedge ratio decisions and would not exercise delegated investment discretion. The F/X overlay may be
implemented internally or externally. If external, the non-discretionary F/X overlay manager would not fall
Investment Policy Statement, Page 26 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025




















under the definition of either an External Manager or a Hedge Fund. A non-discretionary external F/X overlay
manager would merely implement the investment decision that has already been made by the IIC.
## 10.3 Credit Risk Management
a. External counterparty exposures – The maximum allowable unsecured external counterparty exposure for
OTC derivative transactions is $500 million, based on the total net market value of all OTC positions held
with each external counterparty. The total external counterparty exposure for each external counterparty,
including the collateralized portions of these agreements, may not exceed 5% of the market value of the
Total Fund. The minimum credit rating for an external counterparty (which may be a counterparty risk
assessment or rating), based on a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (“NRSRO”), must be
at least A- or better at the inception of the contract. For any external counterparty that experiences
deterioration in credit quality that results in a NRSRO rating below the A- level, subsequent to the inception
of transaction, additional eligible collateral may be posted, or the transaction may be terminated.
b. All OTC derivatives with an external counterparty must be governed by an ISDA Master Agreement and
Credit Support Annex or, if centrally cleared, by clearing agreements, and must include both close-out
netting provisions and collateralization provisions.
c. Each ISDA Master Agreement must also include a table that delineates the excess purchased securities
margin (haircut) required, based on the collateral type, duration, and credit quality.
d. Repurchase agreements – The limit for each counterparty for repurchase transactions and tri-party
repurchase transactions may not exceed 5% of the market value of the Total Fund. Each repurchase
agreement will be entered into under a widely accepted industry-approved form, such as one approved by
SIFMA. A counterparty to a repurchase agreement must be an organization rated A3/A- or better by a
NRSRO, unless (i) the counterparty is another entity created by the Texas legislature; (ii)  the counterparty
is a money-market fund regulated under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or a fund
designed to resemble such a money-market fund regulated under Rule 2a-7 or (iii) the counterparty is a
pension fund or retirement system created by a government entity, whether non-U.S. or domestic and
approved by the CIO.
e. Securities lending – When securities lending activity is performed by an external third-party lending agent,
Investment Division will examine the credit underwriting practices of the lending agent, including
enforcement of collateral requirements, counterparty analysis, and surveillance. Additionally, Investment
Division will periodically review the securities lending lines by counterparty. A securities lending agent
must be either (i) an organization rated A- or better by a NRSRO or (ii) insured by an organization rated A-
or better by an NRSRO and execute a securities lending agreement as required by applicable law. More
detailed information about TRS securities lending activities is specified in the separate Securities Lending
## Policy.
## 10.4 Liquidity Risk Management
The objective of Liquidity Risk Management is to ensure that the Fund maintains ample liquidity to meet its
funding requirements. The two kinds of requirements which necessitate prudent liquidity are:
a. Disbursements of benefits and related obligations to plan participants, including retirement, death, health,
and disability benefits payments.
b. TRS investment activities: These are mainly associated with risk management and funding of External
Managers and Private Funds. Some examples include:
i. Use of derivative instruments requires liquidity for collateral, margin and payment obligations at the
time of a reset, call or maturity;
ii. TRS funds accounts managed by External Managers; and
Investment Policy Statement, Page 27 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025
















iii. TRS manages unfunded capital commitments that the Fund is legally obligated to fund when called by
general partners.
## External Funding Authority
The Investment Division is authorized to establish external funding mechanisms (such as master repurchase
agreements with one or more counterparties) and the flexibility to operate in all types of market liquidity
environments to allow prudent management of these funding requirements while achieving a long-term rate of
return and adhering to the asset allocation limits outlined in this Policy. In addition to these external funding
mechanisms, TRS will maintain adequate funds in its custodial account to cover investment-related obligations.
Finally, the Board authorizes the Investment Division to access the cash holdings backing OTC swaps to
manage its commitments.
## 10.5 Operations Risk Management
a. Overdrafts – The Investment Division will monitor the frequency and costs associated with all overdraft
activity.
b. Custodial Bank(s) – The Investment Division will conduct on-site due diligence to review the operational
controls set in place by all custodial banks. The Investment Division will also consider the extent of
remedies provided by the custodian and its overall ability to fulfill its commitments should operational
failures occur.
## 10.6 Settlement Risk Management
The Investment Division will monitor unsettled trade activity by counterparty and instrument type.
## 10.7 Legal Risk Management
Legal documentation for all accounts, investment subscriptions, External Managers, investments in Private
Investment Funds, and derivatives will be reviewed, negotiated and approved for TRS execution by internal or
external legal counsel, or both. The Investment Division, in consultation with Legal and Compliance, will
exercise diligence to ensure that all contracts are legally binding and enforceable in a suitable venue. The
Investment Division will seek the assistance, review, and advice of legal counsel whenever it is prudent to do so.
Legal and Compliance has primary responsibility for the engagement of outside legal counsel for investment
matters, subject to applicable statutes and rules adopted by the Office of the Attorney General.
10.8 Risk Management Compliance Cure Periods and Remedies
Passive violations – A passive violation occurs when the portfolio breaches a prescribed policy limit as the
result of changing market or credit conditions. The Investment Division will report the violation to the Board
and will remedy the violation within 90 days of the violation or prepare a written action plan that must be
approved by Board resolution to extend the cure period beyond 90 days.
Active violations – An active violation is caused by entering into an agreement or investment that breaches a
policy limit at inception or thereafter through failure to monitor. In this case, a thorough analysis of controls will
ensue and be reported to the CIO, the Executive Director and the Chair of the appropriate Board committee, as
soon as practical, and to the full Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting at which investment matters will
be discussed. The Investment Division will seek to remedy the violation when possible. In instances where the
costs of immediate remedies are prohibitive, the Investment Division will develop a corrective action plan that
will be submitted to the CIO within a reasonable time after the violation occurs, not to exceed 15 days,
depending on the nature and complexity of the investment holding and transactions needed to remedy the
violation. The Board will be apprised of the violation at its next regularly scheduled meeting along with the
corrective action plan.
Investment Policy Statement, Page 28 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025

















10.9 Permitted Sources of Leverage Financing
The Investment Division is authorized to use the following in order to create Strategy or Asset Allocation
## Leverage:
a. Derivative strategies in accordance with the risk parameters established by the asset allocation ranges of this
Policy and applicable legal restrictions;
b. Short sales in accordance with this Policy;
c. F/X hedging in accordance with this Policy;
d. Risk Parity investments in accordance with this Policy;
e. Embedded leverage within the Total Fund’s Private Fund investments; and
f. Collateralized fundings including securities lending activities, pledges, repurchase and reverse repurchase
agreements and other external funding mechanisms.
Leverage will not be used to exceed the risk parameters established by the asset allocation ranges of this Policy.
## HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM PORTFOLIO
## 11.1 Health Insurance Program Portfolio Objective
The primary objective of the Health Insurance Program Portfolio is to preserve capital through investment in
conservative, short-term securities.
11.2 Authorized Investments for the Health Insurance Program Portfolio
Section 404.024, Texas Government Code describes the Authorized Investments employed by the comptroller
when he or she invests state funds. The Investment Division shall employ this list of Authorized Investments
when the Investment Division invests the Health Insurance Program Portfolio.
## INVESTMENT INTEGRITY POLICY
## 12.1 Scope
The Investment Integrity Policy (the “IIP”) applies to all TRS investment transactions, including without
limitation new agreements (including SPACs, follow-on funding, and co-investments), sales or transfers of
investment interests, increases in funding or capital commitment to an existing relationship or fund, or an
amendment that increases management fees or compensation under an agreement. This IIP does not apply to
Direct Investments or transactions in publicly traded securities.
The IIP also applies to attempts to influence TRS investment decisions through contacts with TRS trustees, or
contacts with, or political contributions made for the benefit of, one or more Texas Candidates or Elected
Officials, and also applies to contacts with persons employed by any such candidate or official.
If any provision of the IIP conflicts with a provision of another policy adopted by the Board, the stricter
provision shall apply.
This Article 12 does not apply to direct TRS engagements of Consultants and agents in connection with buying
or selling privately issued investment interests in the secondary market. A seller in a secondary market
transaction is not required to complete an Investment Integrity Questionnaire if the transaction’s closing
Investment Policy Statement, Page 29 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025












documents include appropriate representations, warranties, and covenants as to the matters addressed in this
Article 12 and the Investment Integrity Questionnaire.
## 12.2 Purpose
The purpose of the IIP is to ensure the integrity of all TRS investment transactions and decisions and conformity
with the highest fiduciary, ethical, and legal standards by all parties involved. All investment decisions made by
the Board and the Investment Division must be based solely on the merits in conformity with fiduciary standards
and applicable law. All advice and investment recommendations made by Consultants must be based solely on
the merits after the necessary due diligence. All investment decisions and recommendations must be free of
impropriety or improper influence and the appearance of either.
## 12.3 Philosophy
The Board desires that the Investment Division obtain full disclosure of all matters having the potential to harm
TRS’ reputation or the integrity of TRS’ investment processes, or that could constitute unethical or unlawful
conduct during the investment due diligence process.
12.4 Required Disclosures and Questionnaire
All external Fund or Manager Parties and if applicable, all Placement Agents that will receive a Placement Fee
in connection with an investment or commitment by TRS, shall provide true and complete written responses to
the questionnaire attached hereto as Appendix E prior to IIC consideration or other investment authorization.
The Executive Director is authorized to approve such revisions to Appendix E from time to time as he or she
deems to be in the best interest of TRS and consistent with the IIP.
In addition, all Fund or Manager Parties who disclose the involvement of a Placement Agent shall provide a
detailed description of the services to be performed by the Placement Agent and how the Placement Agent is
used (e.g., with all prospects, or only with a subset of prospects). The Investment Division shall obtain a copy or
summary of the terms of an agreement to compensate a Placement Agent for the due diligence file. The
Investment Division shall provide all prospective Fund or Manager Parties with a copy of the IIP and the
Appendix E questionnaire upon commencement of due diligence.
12.5 Contractual Representations, Warranties, and Covenants
Each Fund or Manager Party shall represent and warrant to TRS in the executed closing documents for the
transaction that its responses to Appendix E to this Policy and any supplemental inquiries are true, correct, and
complete in all material respects as of the closing date, and shall also covenant to update or correct any such
responses within 10 business days of becoming aware of any change in the responses. The obligation to update
responses survives the closing of the relevant investment transaction.
In addition, each Placement Agent shall fully disclose the terms of its arrangements with a Fund or Manager
Party for payment of a Placement Fee and any political contributions by the Placement Agent to any Texas
Candidates or Elected Officials, and shall certify as to the matters addressed in Appendix E, as applicable, to
TRS in a writing executed by an authorized officer that the disclosures required by the IIP are true and complete
in all material respects.
A Placement Agent must agree in writing to pay to TRS a sum equal to its Placement Fees relating to TRS’
investment if the Placement Agent’s certifications, representations, warranties, or questionnaire responses are
untrue or misleading.
A Fund or Manager Party using a Placement Agent must agree in writing to pay to, credit to TRS’ capital
account, or offset TRS’ management fees or outstanding funding commitment with, a sum equal to the
Placement Fees due to the Placement Agent with respect to TRS’ investment agreement or commitment if the
Investment Policy Statement, Page 30 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025













Fund or Manager Party’s certifications, representations, warranties, or questionnaire responses are untrue or
misleading.
## 12.6 Prohibitions
Neither TRS nor any TRS investment shall be burdened with or liable for any Placement Fee. No TRS
investment may be made if the transaction involves either (a) a Placement Agent who is not registered with
either of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”),
or (b) the sharing of a Placement Fee with a non- registered person or entity. No TRS investment may be made
if an authorized officer or the board, in consultation with legal counsel, determines that a disclosed contact with
a Board member or Texas Candidate or Elected Official, or a contribution to a Texas Candidate or Elected
Official, has created an unacceptable risk to the integrity and reputation of the TRS investment program or has
been made in violation of a TRS policy or applicable law. A contact-based referral, without more, by a TRS
trustee of either an investment opportunity or a Manager or Fund Party contact to the Executive Director, or
Chief Investment Officer does not constitute such a risk or a violation of the IIP.
## 12.7 Reporting
The investment staff shall compile all responses to the questionnaire and report the results to the Board at least
semi-annually. Reports shall include the amounts and recipients of any political contribution or Placement Fee
and the relationship of the recipients to the Placement Agent or Texas Candidate or Elected Official, as
applicable.
## 12.8 Definitions
Affiliate – means a person or entity controlled by or under common control with another person or entity.
Direct Investment – means any private placement investment where TRS is a purchasing signatory to a binding
securities purchase agreement or any similar acquisition agreement (including an option or rights agreement to
acquire such securities in the future), and when delivered, intends to hold the restricted securities directly in the
TRS custodian bank.
Fund or Manager Party – means any person or entity offering, sponsoring, proposing, or soliciting a TRS
investment transaction or opportunity, purchase or sale of securities, investment contract, investment
management agreement, or commitment, and includes:
a. As to a private investment fund, a fund sponsor, the general partner, managing member, or its equivalent
with respect to a fund, fund sponsor, or fund management firm;
b. As to an external investment manager to be engaged to invest TRS assets pursuant to an investment
management agreement, the investment management entity and the parent of such asset management entity;
and
c. As to a private company or similar issuer in a direct or principal investment in securities of the issuer, the
entity and an agent, representative, broker or investment bank, officer, director, trustee, manager, or
employee of the company or issuer involved.
Without limiting the foregoing, Fund or Manager Party includes any Affiliate, principal, owner, agent, manager,
officer, majority or controlling shareholder, director, managing member, or employee having authority to legally
bind or otherwise act under actual or apparent authority on behalf of a Fund or Manager Party in connection
with a prospective TRS investment. An underwriter in a registered offering is not a Fund or Manager Party or
Placement Agent under the IIP.
Placement Agent – includes any third party, whether or not affiliated with a Fund or Manager Party, that is a
party to an agreement or arrangement (whether oral or written) with a Fund or Manager Party for the direct or
indirect payment of a Placement Fee in connection with a TRS investment. Any other person or entity who
Investment Policy Statement, Page 31 of 47, rev. eff. 9/18/2025





claims a Placement Fee or who by agreement with a Placement Agent will share in a Placement Agent’s
Placement Fee is also deemed to be a Placement Agent whether or not the person or entity is an Affiliate,
principal, agent, owner, officer, shareholder, director, managing member, or employee of the first Placement
Agent. For the avoidance of doubt, a finder, broker-dealer, originator, fundraiser, financing arranger, or
investment bank receiving a Placement Fee is a Placement Agent. An underwriter in a registered offering is not
a Fund or Manager Party or Placement Agent under this policy.
Placement Fee – includes any compensation or payment, directly or indirectly, of a commission, finder’s fee, or
any other consideration or benefit to be paid to a party other than the relevant Fund or Manager Party in
connection with a TRS investment, agreement or commitment. An underwriting fee or discount charged in a
144A or registered public offering of securities is not a Placement Fee.
Relative – means a spouse (including an ex-spouse), parent, child (including adopted), sibling, niece, nephew,
aunt, or uncle.
SPAC – means a “special purpose acquisition company” with no commercial operations that is formed to raise
capital through an initial public offering for the purpose of acquiring an existing company, whether or not pre-
identified.
Texas Candidate or Elected Official – includes any candidate for a statewide office or an elected official of the
State of Texas, including the governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller of public accounts, attorney general,
and any member of the Texas Legislature, and also includes a campaign fund or political action committee, or
PAC organized for or on behalf of a Texas statewide candidate or elected official, and any Relative of a Texas
statewide candidate or elected official. This definition does not apply to candidates for, or elected officials
holding, offices in counties, municipalities, or other local subdivisions of the State of Texas, to state or local
judicial candidates or offices of the State of Texas, or to any federal office or judicial position. A candidate for
an elective federal office who holds a statewide office is deemed to be a Texas Candidate or Elected Official for
purposes of this policy.
TRS Person – means any person listed on Exhibit A attached to Appendix E to this Policy or to any other due
diligence document, and includes without limitation any current or former TRS board member, Executive
Director, Deputy Director, Chief Financial Officer, Investment Division or Legal and Compliance employee,
any investment consultant or actuary, any outside counsel engaged by TRS, and any Relative of a TRS Person,
whether or not listed on an Exhibit A, TRS Persons.

Exposure is defined as the sum of the market value and unfunded commitments for the purposes of Appendix B.
All external investments must be assigned to one of the four portfolios at the time of approval. For the purposes
of the Manager Organization Market Value Limit, market value is based on the most recent month-end values
provided by the custodian and does not include the proposed investment under consideration.
“Affiliate” means any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with,
another person. A “manager organization” includes its Affiliates without regard to the names of the entities. The
Chief Compliance Officer will be responsible for determining the manager organization’s Affiliates that are
applicable for the above limits.
The percentage limit for additional or follow-on allocations or commitments applies to each additional or
follow-on allocation or commitment by a listed portfolio to a manager and is in addition to, and not cumulative
of, the limit specified for initial allocations or commitments. By way of example, if a portfolio initially allocates
0.2% of the Total Fund to a manager, the portfolio may thereafter allocate or commit up to 1.0% in a single
additional or follow-on allocation or commitment to the same manager for a total of 1.2% allocated or
committed to the same manager (0.2%+1.0%). If a portfolio initially allocates 0.2%, then makes an additional
allocation or commitment of 0.8%, and desires to make a further additional or follow-on allocation to the same
manager, the applicable limit for the further additional or follow-on allocation is 1.0% of the Total Fund, for a
total of 2.0% allocated or committed to the manager (0.2%+0.8%+1.0%). All investments occurring in the six
months prior to the follow-on investment, co-investment or additional investment shall be included in the
calculation of the percentage limits. If the initial investment occurred less than six months prior to the current
investment, the initial allocation limit of 0.5% rather than the follow-on allocation limit of 1.0% will apply.
In calculating the available limits, returned capital is excluded from the sum of existing total allocations or
commitments. Committed capital is included during the applicable investment period of a fund without regard to
whether the commitment amount is funded or unfunded or the fund is open-ended. Capital that has been
returned but that is subject to recall by a Private Investment Fund is considered to be committed or allocated for
the purposes of the limits in this Appendix B.

Authority for Special Investment Opportunities. Notwithstanding the limits set forth in this Appendix B, the
CIO may designate an investment opportunity as a “Special Investment Opportunity” if the circumstances
indicate a reasonable probability that a rapid investment response will be required in order for TRS to acquire
the investment in excess of the limits on Investment Division authority set forth in this Appendix B.
Circumstances requiring a rapid response may include, but are not limited to, distressed situations or market
dislocations creating opportunities to acquire interests or assets at pricing that
indicates a reasonable probability that the interests or assets are undervalued or will increase in value. The CIO
shall notify the Executive Director as promptly as possible of the Special Investment Opportunity. The CIO and
the Executive Director shall consult with the Chair of the Board and the Chair of the Investment Management
Committee and determine if it is not practicable to present the opportunity for consideration by the Board. If the
opportunity will not be added to an agenda, and the CIO and the Executive Director conclude that the
investment would be in the best interests of TRS, the CIO and the Executive Director may authorize and
conclude an investment up to $1 billion in that Special Investment Opportunity.
After one investment in a Special Investment Opportunity has been made, no further investment in a Special
Investment Opportunity may be made until the Board has reauthorized the CIO’s authority to designate a
Special Investment Opportunity. Such reauthorization shall renew the CIO’s and the Executive Director’s
authority to invest up to $1 billion in a Special Investment Opportunity under this provision.

## DEFINITIONS
In this Policy,
Consultant means a person or entity engaged by the Investment Division pursuant to a defined scope of work to
provide studies, assistance, investment management services, due diligence services, and advice relating directly
to investment transactions, activities and processes. This definition does not affect any definitions in the Code of
Ethics for Contractors.
Custom benchmark means a benchmark created for or specified in an investment vehicle or IMA that is not a
Policy Benchmark. Investment guidelines for a vehicle or IMA may include one or more custom benchmarks.
Inclusion of a custom benchmark in an IMA does not modify the investments authorized in this Policy.
External Manager means an investment adviser engaged pursuant to an investment agreement to invest TRS
assets on a discretionary basis pursuant to contractual guidelines negotiated, prescribed or controlled by TRS. A
manager or general partner of a Private Fund is not an External Manager.
Trust or Fund means the overall investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents.
Fund Policy Benchmark is a target allocation-weighted aggregation of the individual Policy Benchmarks
according to Section 1.6.
Investment Management Agreement or IMA means a contract between TRS and an External Manager for the
discretionary investment of TRS assets in securities according to specified guidelines. The account managed by
an External Manager is sometimes referred to as a separate account.
Policy Benchmark means the relevant benchmark for an asset class listed in the allocation table in Section 1.6.
Private Investment Fund or Private Fund means any non-publicly traded limited liability investment vehicle
aggregating investment capital for reinvestment, including without limitation reinvestment of capital in private
companies, other investment funds, real estate, debt instruments, derivatives, commodities, or publicly traded
securities. Private Funds generally issue Restricted Securities to investors through private placements.
Publicly traded securities means securities that trade on a national securities exchange or in an over-the-
counter market through broker-dealers who make a market in securities.
Restricted Securities means securities acquired under an exemption from registration under the securities laws,
such as through private placements, 144A offerings, or Regulation D offerings. Restricted Securities may not be
transferred unless they are registered or are exempt from the registration requirements. SEC Rule 144(a)(3) lists
types of transactions in which Restricted Securities occur. Privately offered limited partnership and limited
liability company interests are usually Restricted Securities.
Securities has the meaning assigned in Section 825.301(a). Whether notes, local access products, warrants or
other financial instruments or contracts are securities requires legal analysis.

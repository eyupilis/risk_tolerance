What to include in an
investment policy statement
## T
his document provides charities with some guidance on what to include in an investment
policy statement. It aligns with OSCR’s guidance on investment matters as well as the  Charity
Commission’s investment policy framework for charities in England and Wales.
An investment policy statement sets out a charity’s investment objectives and how it intends to
achieve them, which in turn enables the trustees to demonstrate they have complied with their duties.
It also provides investment managers with a framework to make informed investment decisions within
the charity’s parameters.
The investment policy statement must be owned by the trustees rather than an investment manager.
However, many trustees find it useful to prepare the statement in consultation with their investment
manager, which can help to ensure it is both realistic and workable.
The level of detail that is relevant for your investment policy statement depends on a variety of factors.
Some charities only hold cash on deposit, which means a simple and short document is usually
sufficient. Those with more complex investment requirements need to include more comprehensive
information.
A good place to start is by writing the heading, which would typically include your charity’s name,
registration number and the date of the policy. Most statements then comprise the following sections.
## 1.  Introduction
Introduce your charity and set out the background to the investment policy to provide context for the
rest of the document. This section should include information like:
ȣthe overall value of your organisation’s assets (including any property) and the amount available
for investment
ȣthe role the investments play within your charity’s business model
ȣthe governance arrangements – for example, do you have an investment committee?
-  Investment objectives
When defining your charity’s investment objectives, consider your overall financial position and your
short and long-term financial commitments. Include other policies as part of this exercise, particularly
those relating to financial risk and reserves. You may wish to include details about:
ȣoverall return expectations
ȣpreference between capital growth and income
ȣfuture spending commitments the portfolio will fund
ȣwhere income generation dominates, can the charity use capital to meet its objectives if required?
ȣany ‘restricted’ funds where a donor has imposed restrictions on when you can use them.

-  Time horizon
The time horizon will influence the amount of risk your investment strategy can take in order to
meet its objectives. Typically, a longer-term approach provides the flexibility to take more risk because
it allows time for a portfolio to recover from any short-term periods of weak investment performance.
Time horizon can be framed as short term, medium term or long term. You may even decide to split
your assets into a number of ‘pots’ to reflect different periods of time.
When stating short, medium or long term it might help to include the number of years as a guide.
For example:
-  Attitude to risk and capacity for capital loss
Setting your charity’s attitude to risk can be challenging because there are many types of risk to take
into account. We have listed five of the key risks below along with questions trustees should consider:
Capital risk
Your portfolio could fall in value. This risk is greatest for a portfolio with a short time horizon because
if it suffers a substantial fall in value, there may not be enough time to recoup the losses. It is less of
an issue for charities that have a longer time horizon, which should be able to tolerate a higher level of
volatility in the expectation of achieving a higher return.
ȣIs there a limit to the fall in value of your portfolio that your charity is willing to tolerate?
ȣAre spending expectations tied to the portfolio within the discretion of your charity or an absolute
commitment? If the former, then you may be able to accept more capital risk and have a greater
capacity for loss, meaning the portfolio could be invested in assets that have the potential to
deliver a higher level of growth.
Inflation risk

Your portfolio might not grow at a pace that keeps up with inflation (which erodes the spending power
of money). Inflation is a big risk for a portfolio that is invested for the long term.
ȣIs inflation a risk for your charity’s portfolio?
Currency risk
An asset denominated in a foreign currency could fall in value against the pound.
ȣWhat is the base currency of your portfolio? The answer is likely to be the same as the currency in
which most of your charity’s commitments lie.
Your answers to these questions will help determine your charity’s risk appetite and guide your
investment manager to an appropriate investment strategy.
-  Liquidity risks and requirements
Liquidity risk
You may not be able to sell an investment when you want to. For example, it is quick and easy to
sell most shares and government bonds. However, some other types of investments, such as some
corporate bonds and alternative funds, could be difficult to sell under certain market conditions.
Short termMedium termLong term
Up to 1 year1 to 5 yearsMore than 5 years

Your policy should include information about any:
ȣongoing spending requirements and whether you want to fund them from investment income and/
or capital if necessary
ȣsignificant capital requirements and likely timings
ȣrestrictions on the proportion of the portfolio that may be held in less liquid assets (to cater for the
above and for unexpected events).
-  Eligible asset classes
This section should state which asset class you can invest in and might also include any maximum and
minimum ranges for each asset class.
-  Management, reporting and monitoring
Set out how you would like your investment manager(s) to communicate with you. Typically, this
section covers:
ȣfrequency of reports (quarterly is standard)
ȣthe information you require in the reports
ȣfrequency of face-to-face meetings with your investment manager (usually once or twice a year)
ȣdetails of the authorised signatories and who can make decisions
ȣwhether your charity has an investment committee.
-  Performance benchmarks
Trustees should set a performance benchmark that will help them assess their investment manager.
There are various measures, and the one that is appropriate for your charity will depend on your
investment objective and strategy. Some of the most commonly used benchmarks include:
Cash/inflation plus
For example, the Retail Price Index +3% a year.
Composite market index
The expected long-term average asset allocation of the portfolio is taken as the neutral position.
Appropriate market indices are then applied to each asset class held in the portfolio according to
their neutral percentage allocations. This might include the FTSE All Share for UK equities, FTSE
World Equity (ex UK) for overseas equities and FT Government All Stocks for UK bonds. Adding
these numbers together gives a composite market index against which the performance of the whole
portfolio may be measured.
Peer group
There are a number of charity peer group benchmarks, such as those provided by ARC and Teknometry.
The trustees should select the one that is most closely aligned to their charity’s objectives.
It’s important to ensure any benchmarks you select are appropriate for your investment strategy,
and that they are not very easy or difficult to beat.

-  Ethical policy
An ethical investment policy can help align your charity’s investments with your objectives.
Trustees should put their own personal views about what may be ethical to one side when they
consider this subject.
Ethical investing could be negative screening, which involves avoiding certain companies and
sectors, such as tobacco. Alternatively, it could be positive screening, such as investing in companies
that demonstrate high standards of governance and contribute to creating a more socially and
environmentally sustainable world. Or it could involve stakeholder engagement, where the charity
exercises its voting rights that come with the company shares it owns. A charity’s ethical policy may
include one or more of these approaches.
Equally charities may choose not to adopt a screening approach and be content with appointing
an investment manager who has a demonstrable approach to responsible investing through their
investment philosophy and process.
Charity trustees have a duty to seek “the maximum financial return consistent with commercial prudence”.
First, if a particular investment would conflict with the aims of the charity. For example, an organisation
involved in protecting the environment may decide not to invest in companies that have poor
environmental records.
Second, if the charity might lose supporters or beneficiaries if it did not invest ethically. An organisation
can avoid investments that might hamper its work, either because potential beneficiaries would
be unwilling to be helped due to the source of the charity’s money or (more likely in practice) by
alienating potential donors. For example, donors to a cancer research charity might be less willing to
give if the charity invests in companies that manufacture cigarettes. The trustees must balance the
likely cost of lost support (for example, the loss of potential donations) against the risk of financial
underperformance if its investment policy excludes tobacco companies from its portfolio.
Third, if there would be no risk of significant financial detriment. Trustees may be able to conclude,
after taking advice if necessary, that a particular ethical policy is likely to perform just as well as an
unrestricted policy. If a charity’s ethical policy is to invest in a positive manner in companies that
demonstrate high standards of corporate social responsibility and governance, then this may be
relatively easily satisfied. This is because there is an increasingly held view that such companies are
likely to deliver the best long-term balance between risk and return.
This section of the investment policy statement should include:
ȣyour charity’s ethical approach (negative screening, positive screening, stakeholder engagement or
a combination)
ȣwhether the policy relates to both direct and indirect (via a pooled fund) investments
ȣtolerances around ethical investments. For example, your charity will not invest in companies that
generate more than 10% of revenues from alcohol or tobacco.
## 9.  Restrictions
Specify any constraints you wish to impose, such as:
ȣexcluding investments in non-investment grade bonds
ȣcash balances only being deposited with institutions that have a minimum credit rating of A
ȣlimiting the proportion of the portfolio that can be invested in non-sterling assets
ȣexcluding investments in derivatives other than for hedging purposes
ȣlimiting a single direct equity investment to no more than 5% of the portfolio
ȣexcluding investments that cannot be sold within three months.

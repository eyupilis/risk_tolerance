Some of the most important and far-reaching
decisions families make relate to how their wealth
is invested. An Investment Policy Statement (IPS)
serves as a strategic guide for families and family
offices in planning and executing an investment
program. Ensuring an IPS is centered in and aligned
with the family’s mission and values can help ensure
the family flourishes now and in the future.
In our approach, an IPS creates a framework for how assets should
be managed relative to a family’s mission, serving as a strategic
guide to planning and executing an investment program. When
implemented successfully, an IPS anticipates issues related to:
-      Governance of the investment program
-     Planning for the appropriate risk-focused asset allocation
-      Implementing an investment program with both internal
and/or external managers
-      Monitoring the results
-      Managing risk
-      Reporting appropriate information on a regular basis

The IPS implements a governance framework that enforces
accountability for all stages of investment policy development and
implementation. It can reinforce the obligations of advisers to offer
counsel and of principals to ultimately approve or disapprove the
policy. In addition, an IPS can help address the financial needs of the
family. It can offer guidance around managing distributions to meet
individual family member’s financial needs or philanthropic goals.
An IPS also establishes accountability for the various entities that may
work on behalf of the investor(s). Perhaps most importantly, it serves
as a guide that can offer an objective course of action to be followed
during periods of market disruption when emotional or instinctive
responses might otherwise provoke less prudent actions that can lead
to behavioral investment mistakes.
In our whitepaper, The Family Focused Family Office, we highlighted
how families should establish a framework centered around the
family that fosters initiatives to enhance family communication,
strengthen bonds and forge connections, as well as support family
members to articulate the family’s purpose and vision for the future.
Building on this framework, we present a similar approach to the IPS
that anchors this critical document in the family’s mission and values.

Family mission
statement
In advance of crafting an IPS, it is
important to engage the family
across generations to establish
a set of guiding principles.
A family mission statement can
help articulate these principles as
well as a shared vision. A family
mission statement that holds
merit should embody the values
of generations past, present and
future so it reflects the values of
the entire family.

A thoughtful family mission
statement articulates a shared
sense of purpose, provides a
comfortable basis for ongoing
dialogue, offers guidance to rising
generation family members as to
what the family is all about, and
incorporates each family members’
unique thoughts, talents, and
contributions. It may be a couple
of lines or a few paragraphs.
Whatever its length, it ideally tries
to answer these five questions:
–  Who are we?
–  What are our values?
–  What do we stand for?
–   What do we want to do?
–    How will we accomplish
our goals?
Through this process, the family
can develop key guiding principles
for responsible stewardship. At a
high level, these principles should
focus on the most important
issues for the family. Additionally,
you want them to be durable
with the ability to address
future developments, as well as
strengthen communication among
family members, and cohesion
around the family mantra.

mission statements.

## Investment
committee
Once a family mission statement
is in place, the family’s guiding
principles and goals should directly
tie to the investment objectives
and risk appetite. Additionally,
consideration should be given
to defining the investor(s), their
tax status and understanding
of the ownership entity of the
asset. Key to ensuring that the
family’s objectives are met is
implementing an Investment
Committee to incorporate
principles that foster collaboration
and transparency. The Investment
Committee develops the
investment strategy, often in
discussions with the family
office and external investment
advisors, and memorializes it in
a well-thought-out investment
policy statement. The IPS acts
as the foundational document
that professionalizes the family’s
investment management function.
The family Investment Committee
provides oversight and monitoring
of stakeholders who are
delegated with implementing
the IPS. The ideal IPS is created
as a partnership between the
Investment Committee and family,
and ultimately agreed to by vote
of the Investment Committee and
officially implemented through the
key designated members. The IPS
should be structured for multi-
generational objectives, while
allowing the space for flexibility
and updates where needed. The
Investment Committee should
review the provisions outlined
within the IPS to ensure that needs
and the desired outcomes are met.
Considerations for framing
an Investment Committee
-   Does the family envision an
## Investment Committee?
-   What will be the criteria
for the members?
-   Will it include family
members as well as
external professionals?
-   Will the committee have
the sole responsibility of
crafting a clear and cogent
investment philosophy?
-   Is the Investment Policy
Statement consistent
with furthering the
organization’s objectives?

Investment Committee roles
and responsibilities
As noted, the Investment Committee has direct responsibility for
developing investment policies and procedures, as well as overseeing
and managing investments.
Specifically, it will:
-      Determine risk tolerance and
investment horizon, which
in turn establish reasonable
and consistent investment
objectives, policies and
guidelines which will direct
the investment of the assets
as reflected in the IPS.
-     Project financial needs of
recipient(s) and communicate
such needs to the investment
managers on a timely basis.
-      Determine the allocation and
implementation of assets,
acting within the parameters
of the IPS and liquidity needs.
-     Provide specific guidelines for
the investment of assets:
–      Are there any restrictions
either by industry or sector?
–      Does the portfolio have a
sustainable investment lens?
–     Suitability risks and benefits?
–     Active, passive or both?
-      Oversee the assets and review
## Investment Performance
–      Measure portfolio and
manager performance
against specific benchmarks
and the financial goals
of the corpus over time.
Additionally, performance
should be measured
against like peers and
comparable universe(s)
based on prevailing
market conditions within
a specified time period.
–     IPS Monitoring measures
the portfolio against specific
boundaries established by
the Investment Committee;
ultimately the boundaries,
or rules, drive investment
and manager selection for
the portfolio, and should be
measured in concert with
performance evaluations.
-      Review and, where possible,
control investment expenses.
–     All expenses must be
customary and reasonable,
and will be borne by
the portfolio as deemed
appropriate and necessary.
6 of 20

–     Specific return objectives,
spending rates and portfolio
risk breakdown should be
stated and be reasonable
in light of each other.
–      The spending rate should
detail whether it is
gross or net of fees.
-      Review this policy, along with
those retained to assist the
committee, at least annually,
recommending changes to
the Investment Committee.
## •     Provide Investment Monitoring
reports on a quarterly basis. The
Investment Committee should
be responsible for maintaining
detailed records of all invested
funds and for carrying out
the investment policies and
procedures established by
the Investment Committee.
-      Integrate the mission and
family values into investment
decisions, including criteria for
securities eligible for inclusion
in portfolios, i.e., sustainable/
ESG/impact investing.
The development of the IPS is
an iterative process of creating
and refining a document serving
as an investment road map
for all parties engaged in the
investment operations of the
plan or investment pool.

## Risk
The IPS becomes the keystone in
how the assets are to be managed
and how to appropriately size
the risk underwritten in the
asset allocation. There are many
variables to measure risk, with
the most common being to use
standard deviation as a short-hand
measurement. That said, for many
families, an unexpected market
drawdown putting significant
principal at risk or failure to meet
long-term goals is a key focus. For
that reason, as we think about the
asset allocation, the portfolio’s
goal is to balance the various risks
to provide a high probability of
success in meeting the targeted
return with the least amount
of volatility.
Providing investment counsel to
individuals requires addressing a
variety of priorities and concerns
in addition to the absolute bottom
line of investment performance.
The investment strategy must be
considered in the context of the
family’s overall financial plan,
short- and long-term objectives,
risk tolerance, liquidity needs,
and preferences. The potential
complexity associated with taking
all of these factors into account in
an investment strategy requires a
disciplined approach.

The investment process
The investment process is designed to achieve replicable, high-quality
results through applying intellectual rigor, strong process governance
and clear responsibility to customize asset allocation advice to meet
specific investor goals and objectives. Each investment should have a
defined purpose within the portfolio and aid in meeting key objectives,
when viewed holistically.
-   Description of assets included
in analysis
-   Investment time horizon
-   Investment objectives, i.e.,
growth, capital preservation
-   Risk considerations
-   Investment preferences and
other considerations
-   Target strategic asset allocation
with deviation guidelines
## •   Income/distribution/liquidity
considerations
-   T   ax, trust and estate
planning considerations and
contact information
-   Rebalancing rules
As Maginn and Tuttle (1994)
wrote, a good investment
policy covers not only the
asset allocation, but is squarely
focused on risk tolerance, return
expectations and realized returns,
and any investment and liquidity
restrictions. Building on this
thought in addition to the asset
allocation, consider creating both
a fee and liquidity budget.
Since we believe that the IPS
should be tailored for the
particular family, it is rare to find
a concrete road map. Our CIO
has provided a brief schematic
to help guide the portfolio
construction journey. Additionally,
we are fortunate that there is
a class of investor where IPSs
are widely used and often
publicly available: foundations
and university endowments.
However, it is important to keep
in mind that these institutions
don’t pay taxes. The investment
management firm Aperio (now
part of BlackRock) challenged the
thinking of individuals following
the endowment model. In their
study, they pointed out that Yale’s
endowment portfolio would
need to be constructed very
differently if it were taxable. When
comparing the Yale endowment’s
portfolio to a taxable portfolio,
the asset allocation changes
dramatically.

That said, we can
still learn from endowments
on how to build a factor-based
approach to asset allocation.

Portfolio construction
framework
As we turn to the portfolio construction considerations for the IPS,
it’s important to consider the long-term objectives and build an asset
allocation that provides the proper risk profile to underwrite an asset
allocation that has a high probability of success—with a goals-based
approach (See page 14, UBS Wealth Way: A holistic approach).
When thinking about the
allocation, it’s our view that
the allocation focuses on the
desired market factors that create
attractive risk-adjusted returns
and would be implemented
irrespective of investment vehicle,
including both public and private
markets, in a total portfolio
approach. Willis Towers Watson
published a key paper on this
topic coming out of their Thinking
Ahead Institute. A good example
of a total portfolio approach is
that when considering your equity
beta exposure, it’s not just your
public equity allocation but also
the private equity exposure and
any other equity beta exposure
found in the portfolio as well.
Portfolio construction
process involves:
- Defining the investment
universe and risk budget
- Estimating multi-business-cycle
“equilibrium” asset class returns
and a covariance matrix
- Estimating single-business-
cycle (five-to-seven-year) asset
class returns
- Diversifying the contribution of
unique risk drivers
- Sizing active vs. passive
risks where there is edge to
outperform relative to cost
- Consolidating asset class
estimates within one
quantitative platform
- Constructing SAAs based on
optimal risk and return trade-
off, including testing portfolios
across history and possible
future market stress

## 7
Strategic asset
allocation
Key to portfolio construction will be the strategic asset allocation (SAA).
The SAAs are designed to provide an attractive risk-return trade-off
over a full economic cycle, typically a five- to seven-year period. SAAs
are essential as they set the allocation midpoint for fluctuations due to
volatility from year to year.
Because of the asset allocation’s
importance, the Investment
Committee typically retains
approval of the strategic asset
allocation (SAA) decision. A SAA
decision process should entail a
predefined asset class allocation
toward which the portfolio
is to be rebalanced either at
regular intervals or when some
predefined deviation limits are
reached. This approach aims
to keep the portfolio within
a predefined risk level while
generating returns from both the
long-term return expectations
of each asset class and from
the mean-reverting behavior of
asset class performance. Often a
proposal is developed only after a
formal asset allocation study that
incorporates return objectives and
contraints via historical backtests
and simulations (Monte Carlo)
of possible investment outcomes
over an agreed-upon investment
horizon and evaluates the risk/
return characteristics of the
possible allocation strategies.
Asset allocation recommendations
should focus on defining risk
capacity, minimizing tail risks,
exploiting tactical opportunities
and using alternative “betas”
and alpha drivers to meet the
challenging environment investors
face in arranging asset classes to
achieve the targeted risk profile
and most efficient after-tax return.
The SAAs will help to underpin
the fundamentals that frame
investment decisions around risk
and return.
The Investment Committee should
consider constructing consistent
capital market assumptions
(CMAs) of future expected returns
based on market, policy and
economic fundamentals. This
would enable the Committee to
bring together many of the risk
and return parameters of each
asset class used in a proposed
asset allocation to estimate the
overall return and volatility/risk
(standard deviation) of any given
investment portfolio, along with
wealth projections. From here, a
core allocation can be built that
reflects the desired risk profile of
the investor(s), and allows them to
stress-test the allocation relative
to the financial goals and risk
tolerance laid out in the IPS.
The SAA decision determines
return levels irrespective of active
or passive implementation.
11 of 20

## 8
Tactical asset
allocation
The SAAs serve as a midpoint to take into consideration the market’s
volatility effect on the allocation. Tactical asset allocation (TAA) works in
tandem with the SAA, to improve the risk and return trade-offs of the
portfolio by taking advantage of short-term market opportunities—or
mitigating temporary risks—while ensuring that the portfolio remains
within their defined risk profile.
Typical TAA methodology is based
on the view that over a tactical
horizon (six to 12 months),
behavioral biases and fundamental
economic dynamics are the main
drivers of market performance.
These drivers are best understood
by analyzing the business cycle,
market sentiment and momentum,
and to a lesser extent valuation.
The Investment Committee should
have an ongoing assessment
of these drivers to determine
whether a given tilt in the
portfolio is supportive of their
targeted return goals.
Tactical tilts can be used to
rebalance the portfolio, and
tax-loss harvesting can be a very
useful by-product of this process.
That said, tax-loss harvesting
is an important consideration
independent of tactical tilts and
should be pursued throughout
the year. Further, the Investment
Committee should take caution
to properly rebalance the SAA
allocations so as to not change the
underlying portfolio’s risk profile.
The IPS should specify specific
rebalancing actions and avoid
ambiguous rebalancing guidance
that is likely to provide little value.
Rebalancing is better enacted as
a policy decision upfront and not
as a reaction to market events, to
keep portfolios in line with the IPS
risk profile.
Setting tactical ranges to
maintain risk budget
One concern around tactical tilts
is creating a range or bands that
are too large around the SAA
midpoints resulting in changing
the risk profile of the portfolio.
As a word of caution, taking
on too much or too little risk
at market inflection points can
significantly lower the probability
of the portfolio reaching its
targeted goals.

## Portfolio
implementation
Once the asset allocation has
been set, the next steps are
implementation. It will be
incumbent on the Investment
Committee to put a rigorous
due diligence process in place
that breaks down an investment
strategy in order to gain an
understanding of the strategy’s
risk profile and fully understand
how the strategy will perform in
all market environments. No one
ever wants to be surprised, either
by significant underperformance
or unaccountable excess
performance. In the latter case,
surprising outperformance may
suggest that you’ve misread or
misunderstood the strategy’s risk.
Transparency is another key
element of the due diligence
process, ensuring that the
## Investment Committee
understands the strategy. From
here, you can leverage appropriate
products for active management,
as well as consider passive
investment vehicles to round out
the allocation. You may want to
consider incorporating tax-loss
harvesting technology around any
passive investments to provide
incremental tax alpha, depending
on the current environment. From
here, the Investment Committee
can create a diversified portfolio
that seeks to extract the most
return for any given level of risk
with the intent to be on the
efficient frontier. The Harvard
Business School has reviewed the
Yale Endowment over the years,
highlighting the challenge of
finding the efficient frontier, but it
remains a worthy goal.
## 2
At the end of the day, an IPS
should include a clear statement
of investment beliefs. These beliefs
can cover a broad range of topics
as long as they are clearly defined.
Topics will include acceptable
asset classes, investment costs,
spending rates, governance, and
the like. Such clarity provides for
meaningful discourse among
investment decision makers. Such
clarity is better than having to
infer the underlying investment
beliefs from the IPS. Specifying
beliefs can help make the IPS
a document for improving the
portfolio management process.

UBS Wealth Way:
A holistic approach
The UBS Wealth Way approach
is focused on a holistic wealth
philosophy to managing assets
relative to liabilities in such a way
as to accomplish the family’s
objectives through all market
cycles. At its core, this is a
framework of interaction between
performance seeking and liability-
hedging portfolios that allows
for a deeper understanding
of the role that each portfolio
component plays, and for the
portfolio to evolve over time. It
is designed to provide clarity for
all financial decisions embedded
in the family’s specific goals and
objectives over various investment
horizons, while providing a
bulwark against the behavioral
mistakes that investors are prone
to make and reducing inherent
investment biases. By judging a
portfolio on its ability to meet
its financial goals, investors are
better positioned to set realistic
expectations and incorporate
rational decision-making. Knowing
that near-term expenditures
are conservatively segmented
helps investors maintain a long-
term view, and may provide
some comfort when markets
perform poorly.
UBS Wealth Way is an approach incorporating Liquidity. Longevity. Legacy. strategies that UBS Financial Services Inc. and our Financial Advisors can use to
assist clients in exploring and pursuing their wealth management needs and goals over different timeframes. This approach is not a promise or guarantee
that wealth, or any financial results, can or will be achieved. All investments involve the risk of loss, including the risk of loss of the entire investment.
Timeframes may vary. Strategies are subject to individual client goals, objectives and suitability.
14 of 20

The 3L strategy categorizes assets into “sleeves,” based on the specific
timelines of an individual’s needs and goals.
Liquidity: Assets and resources in the Liquidity strategy are allocated
to match expenditures in order to provide stable cash flow for the next
three to five years. The goal of these assets is to provide confidence that
you will meet their financial needs during bear markets and avoid locking
in what are likely temporary losses in risk assets held in the Longevity and
Legacy strategies.
Longevity: The Longevity strategy is earmarked to include all of the
assets and resources the family plans to utilize for the remainder of
their lifetimes, which provides a clear picture of what future spending
objectives will cost. It is also managed with that goal in mind. This
strategy’s priority is to maximize after-tax growth with a well-diversified
portfolio, but with an eye to inflation and managing downside risk.
Legacy: The Legacy strategy is comprised of assets that are in excess of
what the family members need to meet their own lifetime objectives.
The Legacy strategy clarifies how much a family can do to improve the
lives of others—either now or in the future. Investment portfolios in
the Legacy strategy are typically invested fairly aggressively since the
time horizon associated with the portfolio can usually be measured
in decades, and might also include business interests, collectibles,
charitable funds, or multiple homes. In implementing the 3L framework,
UBS has found that clients with large Legacy sleeves will tend to have
more illiquidity via a tilt to private equity investments and depending
on the client’s tax sensitivity the Legacy sleeve will generally have more
alternatives (hedge funds) than a typical wealth management portfolio
as well.
The three sleeves dynamically change over time with the changing needs
and objectives of the family, providing a blueprint to help make sure that
all financial decisions are aligned with those objectives. By understanding
the purpose of different segments of your family’s wealth and managing
risks relative to the time-horizon of goals, you are more likely to make
better decisions over time. Combined, the three portfolios will comprise
your family’s total portfolio.

An investment policy statement (IPS), a document drafted between a
portfolio manager and a client, outlines the rules and guidelines that the
portfolio manager must follow when considering asset allocation in the
clientʼs portfolio. In other words, an investment policy statement outlines
how a portfolio manager is to manage the clientʼs money.

An investment policy statement provides guidance to portfolio
managers when making portfolio decisions. Asset allocation decisions,
client risk tolerance, leverage, liquidity requirements, and foreign
security investment restraints are some examples of issues that are
addressed in an IPS.
## Summary
An investment policy statement is a document drafted
between a portfolio manager and a client that outlines the
client’s portfolio objectives and information relevant to
achieving the objectives.
The components of an investment policy statement are scope
and purpose, governance, investment, return and risk
objectives, and risk management.
An IPS provides guidance to portfolio managers when making
portfolio decisions and helps keep clients from making
emotional decisions related to their portfolio.
Understanding an Investment Policy Statement

A well-constructed investment policy statement provides a framework
for investment decisions made by the portfolio manager and also helps
commit the client to a long-term investment strategy. Emotional
decisions made by the client to the portfolio can be avoided – an IPS
acts to remind clients regarding the overarching goals and strategies of
the portfolio.
Referencing a document published by the CFA Institute, the
components of an investment policy statement are as follows:
Components of an Investment Policy Statement
- Scope and Purpose
Establishing and building context regarding the investorʼs source of
wealth
Identifying and defining the investor
Setting forth roles and responsibilities of the portfolio manager
Identifying a risk management structure
Assigning responsibility for portfolio monitoring and reporting
## 2. Governance
Specifying responsibilities in determining, executing, and monitoring
the results of the implementation of the investment policy statement

Following is a theoretical example of how an investment policy
statement might prevent emotional decisions.
In 2018, an elderly client drafted an IPS with her portfolio manager. The
investment policy statement outlines, among other things, that the
portfolio is restricted from investing in high-risk speculative
investments.
With the impending legalization of cannabis in Canada and seeing the
buzz created by cannabis stocks, the client meets with her portfolio
manager and outlines her idea to shift the entire equity asset allocation
of the portfolio into cannabis stocks to ride the wave. The client
believes that the industry will continue to rise and outperform other
industries.
With a drafted IPS, the portfolio manager indicates to the client that the
portfolio is restricted from investing in high-risk speculative
investments. The portfolio manager outlines that cannabis stocks are
highly speculative as they include revenue growth assumptions that are
unrealistic and are currently trading at extreme valuation multiples.
Stating the return, risk, and spending assumptions (outflows in the
portfolio)
Defining the investorʼs risk tolerance
Describing relevant constraints (liquidity requirements, tax
considerations, restrictions on certain investments, legal constraints)
Describing any other considerations that may be relevant to the
investment strategy
## 4. Risk Management
Establishing performance measurements and reporting
accountabilities
Specifying metrics used to measure and evaluate risk
Defining the process for portfolio rebalancing and target asset
allocations

Additionally, the portfolio manager states that while marijuana stocks
may perform well in the short term due to constant headlines, it would
significantly increase the portfolio risk and potentially jeopardize the
portfolio from achieving its long-term goal.
Understanding the facts presented by the portfolio manager, the client
decides to follow along with the portfolioʼs investment policy statement
and to avoid the cannabis space.

Our Investment Philosophy summary
Your values and desired lifestyle, your investment preferences, needs, attitude to risk, time-horizon
and capacity for loss should be all at the centre of all investment planning.
ï Although not perfect, Capital Markets work and throughout the world they have historically rewarded
long-term investors for the capital they supply.
Risk and return are related, i.e. the only way to earn higher returns over the longer term is to accept
greater risk.
Only take the risks supported by evidence:
- Shares have a higher expected return than fixed-interest investments.
ï Small company shares have a higher expected return than large company shares.
ï Lower-priced ìvalueî shares have a higher expected return than higher-priced ìgrowthî shares.
Employ ìasset class investingî:
ï Structure is the strategy, not speculation, as >90% of a portfolioís investment performance can be
explained by its high-level asset allocation.
Diversify globally across asset classes, industry sectors and investment styles:
- A diversified portfolio can achieve higher expected returns at a lower risk.
Invest in collectives (mutual funds) as these offer greater tax-efficiency and diversification at a lower
cost than direct equity investment.
Keep investment costs down and mitigate tax so that you retain a greater share of the investment
return.
Be disciplined, monitor progress, and stick to the agreed strategy:
ï Remain invested ñ i.e. do not sell in uncertain times or attempt to ìtime the marketî.
ï Portfolios should be rebalanced regularly (we recommend annually), so asset allocation remains
consistent with the original, agreed structure/strategy (see 5 above).
Invest using Passive vehicles (wherever practicable):
ï  Active management can be expensive, and the vast majority of actively managed funds fail to deliver
returns in excess of the market return, especially over the medium to longer term.
ï The often-quoted fundís annual charges [Annual Management Charge (AMC) and Ongoing Cost of
Fund (OCF)] do not include portfolio turnover costs. These additional “hidden” costs are significantly
higher for actively managed funds than for passive funds.
- Asset-class and index-tracker funds target market returns at a low cost and are generally much more
widely diversified (in terms of the number of individual securities held) than actively managed funds.
As a result, these funds typically experience lower volatility than most actively managed funds in the
same fund sector.
## Review Investments Regularly
- Your investments should be reviewed annually, in the proper context of your circumstances and goals
(see point 1 above).

## Introduction
Purpose of investment policy statement
This Investment Policy Statement (IPS) outlines the over-arching principles that guide us in our investment
recommendations.
This IPS will be used as the basis for all investment decisions in order to help you achieve your objectives and manage
the portfolioís investment risk.  Adhering to this investment discipline will help ensure that you stay on course and
avoid emotional reactions to short-term market fluctuations.
The need for an investment policy statement
This IPS describes our investment philosophy and the investment management procedures to be used for the assets
identified for investment.  The principal reason for developing a written investment policy is to protect your portfolio
from ad hoc or irrational revisions and to maintain a sound medium to long-term strategy.
Important information
Capital markets and asset values fluctuate, especially over shorter time periods, therefore it is important to recognise
the possibility of capital loss.  However, historical data suggests that the risk of capital losses can be minimised if the
investment strategy employed under this IPS is maintained for at least five years (and ideally seven years plus).
This IPS does not offer any guarantees and past performance is not a guide to future performance
Investment consulting fees
We operate on a fee-for-service basis as the emphasis is on relationship-driven planning (as opposed to commission
or one-off, product dependant sales).
In line with our Client Agreement, a maximum initial fee of 1% of your investable assets is typically charged to
implement your investment plan.  A maximum ongoing fee of 1% per annum of your investable assets will typically
be charged to manage and administer your investment portfolio.
Typically, lower scale ongoing fees are applied to larger investments (ie >£500,000).
The initial fee can either be paid by cheque or deducted from your funds before investment is made.
The ongoing annual fee is deducted from your portfolio(s) on a monthly basis.
Investment philosophy
There is a ìnew modelî of investing: a model based not on speculation but on the science of capital markets where
decades of research and evidence lead the way.
We recommend a ìpassiveî investment strategy (as opposed to an ìactiveî investment strategy) and the aim of Verus
Wealth is to deliver the performance of capital markets and invest in funds which increase returns through portfolio
design and fund selection.
We do not support tactical asset allocation which is essentially market-timing and speculation. Attempting to forecast
which fund managers will outperform the market or the future movement of an individual security, asset class,
industry sector or geographic region, cannot be achieved with consistent success, because no one knows the future.
In other words, we donít speculate with our clientsí money, we invest it, sensibly.
Our approach is underpinned by the 10 key points listed above and we recommend portfolios which are globally
diversified across asset classes, within asset classes and across industry sectors.

A vital step in constructing your portfolio is defining your attitude to investment risk as this has a direct impact on
returns.  We use Morningstar’s Attitude to Risk questionnaire to help us define your investment risk profile in to one
of the following categories:
## Cautious
As a cautious investor you are very worried about short-term losses. As a cautious investor you are willing to accept a
lower return to help achieve your goal of keeping your investment safe. As a cautious investor you accept that to
achieve a return higher than a very secure investment such as a bank account, your money will be invested in assets
that can rise and fall in value and so your money is at risk and you could lose some of it.
## Moderately Cautious
A moderately cautious investor is worried about short-term losses. As a moderately cautious investor, you are
uncomfortable taking risks with your investment but are willing to do so to help you achieve higher returns than
could be achieved in more secure investments such as a bank or building society account. As a moderately cautious
investor, you are willing to accept lower returns to reduce risk to the value of your investment and can accept that
your money will be invested in assets that can rise and fall in value and so your money is at risk and you could lose
some of it.
## Moderate
The moderate investor is not overly concerned by short-term losses and understands that some risk is needed to have
the opportunity to achieve better returns. The moderate investor believes that the safety of their investment and
investment returns are equally important. The moderate investor is able to leave their money invested despite a fall in
the value of their investment in order to try to recover their losses.
## Moderately Adventurous
The moderately adventurous investor's main aim is to increase the value of their investments. They are willing to
accept a higher risk of losing their money in order to achieve this. A moderately adventurous investor is willing to
leave their money invested despite a large fall in the value of their investment to recover their losses and to achieve
their long-term investment aims.
## Adventurous
The adventurous investor aims to achieve the highest possible returns over the long term. They are not concerned
about possible short-term losses. An adventurous investor is most concerned with high returns and can accept both
large and frequent losses to the value of their investment over time in exchange for the opportunity of a higher return
over the long term.
The portfolio that we create for you will also take account of the following:
- Your current circumstances including lifestyle, financial and investment objectives.
ï Your investment knowledge and experience
- Your capacity for loss
- Your attitude towards past returns data of sample portfolios representing our investment approach.
Importantly, we will consider the level of risk you are ëwillingí to take and the level of risk you are ëableí to take.  We
refer to the former as your sensitivity to volatility (or attitude to risk) and the latter as your capacity for loss.
Essentially, capacity for loss refers to the proportion of your investments which you could afford to lose without
impacting on your desired lifestyle and goals.  Sensitivity to volatility is how much the total value of your investments
could go down before you would begin to feel uncomfortable.

## Example Portfolios
Your portfolio will probably include cash, fixed interest securities (government bonds, corporate bonds) and global
equities/ shares (UK, International and Emerging Markets).
Asset class allocation and target returns for the seven example portfolios are shown below and are for illustrative
purposes only:
*Asset class Mean Assumed Returns are the weighted averages of the Asset Class Assumed Return for each portfolio. These figures exclude product and
adviser charges. These figures are not guaranteed. Past performance is not a reliable guide to future returns.
**As measured by historical 3-year Standard Deviation. This depicts how widely a portfolio’s returns varied over time. When a portfolio has a high
standard deviation, the predicted range of performance is wide, implying greater volatility. In general terms, aapproximately 68% of the time, returns from
the portfolio will fall within one standard deviation of the mean return for the fund, and 95% of the time within two standard deviations. For example, for
a fund with a mean annual return of 5% and a standard deviation of 8%, one might expect about 68% of all annual returns to within the range of -3%
and +13%, and about 95% of all annual returns to be within the range of -11% and +21%.
The UK Government’s current target for inflation is 2.0% per annum.

We have created eight Model Portfolios. Each portfolio
is invested in fixed-interest securities (aka bonds)
and/or equities (aka shares).  The greater the equity
content, the higher the risk (i.e. price volatility) and
also the higher the potential returns.
The equity content within the portfolios varies
between 0% for Ultra-Low Risk investors and 100%
for High Risk investors as follows:

## Investment Policy Factors
Investment time horizon
The length of time you intend to hold your portfolio affects your overall investment strategy.  The longer the expected
holding period, the more likely your portfolio will achieve its target return.
Your recommended portfolio will be designed based on your stated investment time horizon.
Risk tolerance and portfolio volatility
In general, the type of portfolio we propose should suit the level of risk you are ëwillingí and ëableí to take, however
there could be periods when your portfolio experiences periods of volatility out-with your usual risk tolerance.
Income and capital gains tax
No investment decisions should be based solely on tax considerations.  However your personal tax situation is likely to
affect your investment decisions and there may be tax consequences when implementing and rebalancing your
portfolio. Specifically, rebalancing may require the sale of funds where the realized gain will crystalise a Capital Gains
Tax liability. (This consideration does not apply to funds held within Pension, ISA or Investment Bond tax wrappers)
Ongoing Charges Figure (OCF)
The OCF of a fund reflects most of the expenses which are associated with the running of an investment fund. They
are deducted from the fund and are reflected in the fund price. They include the costs of fund management which
are paid for by an explicit charge (the Annual Management Charge) made by the fund manager.  OCFs vary by fund
and over time depending on the costs incurred.
The typical weighted OCF of our portfolios is around 0.18% pa. However, you will be advised of the specific
applicable OCFs in relation to our recommendation in your case. This may be lower or higher than 0.18% pa.
OCF does not include the transaction costs incurred by a the funds (ie the costs associated with buying and selling).
For our portfolios, these costs amount to around 0.05% pa.
The total fund costs for our portfolios are therefore typically around 0.23% pa.
NB: This figure does not include Tax-Wrapper (i.e. platform) fees or Verus Wealth’s ongoing fees.
Liquidity of invested capital (ie non-cash assets)
Personal circumstances can change with little or no notice and funds might be required unexpectedly.  Although
funds can be made available, there may be a delay in transferring these to you as sale of assets might be required to
meet these requirements. All of the funds we recommend offer daily liquidity, although trade settlement periods can
be up to T+3 days in some cases. It may take longer to then extract and pay out the sale proceeds from the platform
to you. We recommend you allow up to ten days for any unscheduled/ ad-hoc capital withdrawals.
ESG Investment factors
ESG stands for “Environmental, Social and Governance”. Also known as “socially responsible investing”, “impact
investing”, and “sustainable investing”, ESG refers to investing in a way which prioritises optimal environmental,
social, and governance (ESG) factors or outcomes. ESG investing is widely seen as a way of investing “sustainably” -
where investments are made with consideration of the environment and human wellbeing, as well as the economy.
Our model portfolios are not screened for ESG factors.
However, where a client expresses a preference or requirement for ESG investing, we offer a bespoke ESG portfolio
service.
We firstly identify (via a comprehensive questionnaire) the positive and negative ESG factors that the client wishes to
include or avoid. We then apply these criteria to a fund screening tool which identifies funds which meet the
selection criteria.

Performance benchmarks
The asset classes reflected in your portfolio will be assessed relative to the following benchmarks:
UK Equities
Asset ClassBenchmark / Index
## Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Float Adjusted Bond
## Global Fixed Interest
UK Corporate Bond
## International Equities
## Global Small / Value Equities
## Emerging Market Equities
Markit iBoxx GBP Non-Gilts Overall TR Index
FTSE All-Share Index
FTSE Developed World Ex-UK Index
MSCI World Small Cap Index
FTSE Emerging Index
From those filtered funds, we then apply other fund selection considerations (such as cost, security and sector
diversification, past performance and how long the fund has been trading) to create a bespoke portfolio
recommendation which most closely meets the clientís needs.
The portfolio will be similarly geographically diversified as our model portfolios and include a suitable blend of
equities and bonds (ie asset allocation) to meet the clientís requirements, taking account of their attitude to risk,
capacity for loss, time horizon and investment objectives.
This portfolio will be reviewed annually to ensure its ongoing suitability.
## Tax-wrappers
The following table summarises the tax-wrappers that can be included in your portfolio:

## Investment Management Guidelines
## Diversification
The single most important strategy used to manage investment risk is diversification.  The following table summarises
the four different types of diversification:
Investment products
In our view, collective investment funds such as unit trusts, open-ended investment companies (OEICs) and exchange
traded funds (ETFs) offer the most attractive and cost-effective means of accessing the global financial markets. It is
virtually impossible to deliver a tax-efficient, sufficiently-diversified investment portfolio at a low-cost, through direct
equity investment only.
## Fund Selection
We generally select and recommend passive-style funds taking account of the following factors:
Fund ongoing costs (ie TER or OCF: the lower the better)
Tracking error and Tracking Difference: we prefer funds with a low tracking error* and a low tracking
difference**
Diversification of the fund’s underlying securities/ assets: the more securities held, the better
Currency: denominated in £GBP only
Manager Domicile: UK or EU only
*Tracking error is the volatility of the difference of the returns between a product and its benchmark. Tracking error is calculated as the standard
deviation of a product's returns against its benchmark. It shows how consistent the fund has been in replicating its benchmark.
**Tracking difference is the difference between a product's return and that of its benchmark over a specific time period. Tracking difference is
calculated by accessing the difference between the return of a benchmark and the return of the fund designed to track it. It shows the
magnitude of underperformance. There will always be an element of tracking difference because of fees. Tracking difference is usually negative,
meaning that the fund underperforms its benchmark net of fees. However, sampling replication and revenue from securities lending can both
cause funds to have a positive tracking difference, in which case the fund has outperformed its benchmark.
Rebalancing of strategic asset allocation
Asset class allocations may fluctuate over time due to market movements.  The portfolio allocations should be
reviewed at least annually.  Cash inflows and outflows can be used to maintain the long-term strategic allocation.
Please refer to Appendix for ëRebalancing Your Portfolioí which this IPS recommends.
Portfolio review and monitoring
You will receive regular statements detailing your existing holdings and any transactions.  We will provide you with a
Portfolio Review at least annually to assess your portfolioís progress and to ensure that the parameters of this IPS
continue to meet your requirements.
DescriptionType
By asset classes
Diversify by investing internationally in companies outside of the UK as well as UK companies.
Diversify within each asset class by holding investments with different risk-return characteristics e.g. across industry
sectors and company size (large, mid and small-cap equities) while bonds are diversified by credit rating and term to
maturity.
Diversify by asset class by combining different asset classes in the portfolio, such as money market, fixed-interest
(bonds), commerical property and equities / shares.
Diversify equities/shares by choosing funds which hold a large number of individual securities.

## APPENDICES

## Appendix I
## Financial Services Compensation Scheme
For investment business, the FSCS provides cover of 100% of the first
£85,000 (per person, per regulated firm) from January 2017.  It is our
view that client investments are protected in the event of insolvency of
a mutual fund manager due to the requirement of the fund manager
to appoint a depositary and custodian.  One of the primary functions
of the custodian is the safekeeping of securities and cash in deposit
accounts, held in the name of the depositary.  This has the effect of
segregating the funds from the fund manager's own monies and
effectively protects the client's investments should the fund manager
become insolvent.
For the investor this means that the only time they would need to look
to the FSCS for compensation would be in the event of the fund
manager acting dishonestly, fraudulently or negligently.
Compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme will
generally not be available in connection with funds domiciled in
Ireland.  These include the Vanguard Global Bond Index fund; the
Vanguard Global Small-Cap index fund; these funds are represented in
our client portfolios.
How are my investments protected in a Vanguard fund?
When investing directly with Vanguard, you own the shares in the
fund once you have paid for them and your name will appear on the
shareholder register. These investments are kept separate from the
assets belonging to VGIL. A separate institution called a depositary
safeguards Vanguard fund assets and looks out for your interests.
The depositary also oversees the fund provider and makes sure
Vanguard fund assets operate properly and in line with regulatory
safeguards.
For funds that have been authorised as Undertakings for Collective
Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), the depositary must be a
separate entity from VGIL, which ensures that the oversight of the
fund management company is fully independent. As your name
appears directly on the shareholder register, in the event of
insolvency of VGIL, you will retain the value of the shares that you
own.
## General
Holdings on the investment platforms / ìfunds supermarketsî are held
in nominee accounts and are separate from the platform providerís
own assets.
Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP)
All portfolios invest in external mutual funds, if the Nominee were to
default, the investments cannot be touched by creditors of the
Nominee.  If an external fund manager defaults, the investments are
still safe.  The assets are held by the appointed Custodian and separate
from the fund manager's own assets and therefore enjoy a robust level
of protection in the event of insolvency of the fund manager.
Stocks & Shares ISA, Personal Portfolio and International Bond
All portfolios invest in mutual funds and fund managers are required
by the FSA to appoint a custodian or depositary who is responsible for
the safekeeping of the assets.  The depositary will normally appoint a
Custodian to act on their behalf.  One of the Custodian's primary
functions is the safekeeping of securities and cash in deposit accounts,
held in the name of the depositary.  This has the effect of segregating
the fund from the fund manager's own monies.  By segregating and
ring-fencing the assets, this should provide adequate protection from
creditors if a fund manager goes into liquidation.
## Investor Protection
Appendix II
Investment in all funds carries with it a degree of risk including, but
not necessarily limited to, the risks referred to in a fund's Prospectus.
There can be no guarantee that the funds invested in will achieve their
investment objective. The Net Asset Value of a fund, and the income
generated from it, may go down as well as up and investors may not
get back the amount invested or any return on their investment.
Investing in securities issued by companies and governments in
different countries, especially those in emerging market countries,
involves considerations and possible risks not associated with investing
in issuers of one country. The values of investment assets dominated in
currencies other than the base currency of a fund are affected by
changes in currency exchange rates. Some bond funds will seek to
adopt currency hedging strategies to mitigate this risk factor.
Investing in multiple jurisdictions involves consideration of different
exchange control regulations, legal risks, tax law, including withhold-
ing taxes, changes in government administration or economic or
monetary policy or changed circumstances in dealings between
nations. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short
periods of time causing a fund's net asset value to fluctuate as well.
## Risk Definitions
ï Investment Market Risk - The possibility that all investments
in a market sector (e.g. shares) will be affected by an event.
ï Investment Specific Risk - The possibility that a particular
investment may under-perform the market or its competitors.
- Inflation Risk - This is the possibility that your investment
return is below the inflation rate which reduces the spending
power of your money.
- Credit Risk - The potential failure of a debtor to pay amounts
they owe. Also known as Default Risk
- Interest Rate Risk - Interest rate risk is the possibility that your
investment will be adversely impacted by a fall or rise in
interest rates.
ï Legislative Risk - Legislative risk is the possibility that a
change in legislation will impact the appropriateness of
certain investments for you.
ï Liquidity Risk - Liquidity risk relates to the ease with which
you can sell or liquidate your investments.  Some investments
impose exit fees or have limitations on your withdrawals.
Other investments may be difficult to sell due to a lack of
buyers.
- Currency Risk - If you invest in funds which invest abroad,
movements in currency exchange rates may cause the value
of your investment to go up or down.
- Counterparty Risk - The risk to each party of a contract that
the counterparty will not live up to its contractual obliga-
tions. Counterparty risk as a risk to both parties and should
be considered when evaluating a contract. In most financial
contracts, counterparty risk is also known as "default risk".

Appendix III
## Investment Types
Cash and Money Market Funds
In the UK, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme guarantees the
capital value of cash on deposit with UK regulated banks up to a
maximum of £85,000.  This is probably done less from goodwill than
to ensure that the British banking system as a whole remains stable.
But while the total sum may be guaranteed, there are still risks to
leaving cash on deposit.  One is inflation, which erodes the purchasing
power of money.  Interest rates may eventually rise to account for
inflation, but only after some delay.  The other is known as ‘opportuni-
ty costí.  Interest rates on cash are set at the lowest level of return.  In
holding cash, investors give up the opportunity of achieving a higher
return for what may only be a moderate amount of additional risk.
## Fixed Interest
Also known as ‘Bonds’, fixed interest investments are generally
thought of as the lower risk among ‘real’ financial assets.  Neither the
income from a fixed interest investment, nor the capital value, is
necessarily guaranteed.  Interest rates are often variable and can be
altered as circumstances evolve, usually in reference to the Bank of
England base rate.  Where the rate of interest cannot be varied, the
capital value will rise or fall to make up the difference.  The following
are examples of different types of Bonds, and their risks.
## 1. Government Bonds
Bonds issued by the UK government ñ commonly referred to as ëgiltsí ñ
are often described as ërisk freeí.  This is not strictly true, as gilt prices
rise and fall daily, but since it is the government that guarantees
sterling deposits (or cash), the risk of holding a government bond is
clearly not much different.  Their risk-free status reflects the low
probability that the UK government would ever default.  It never has in
the past. And it is different to a business in that if it needs money, it
has only to pass a law to raise taxes or print more money.  There are
still some risks to consider, however.  Like cash, the value of govern-
ment bonds can be eroded through inflation.  And like cash, they tend
to pay a small return.  They will tend to be preferred by investors
whose priority is preservation of capital.
Bonds issued by other G5 governments – the US, Germany, France and
Japan ñ are also considered to be risk free.  Again, this is not strictly
true, as we have seen in the successive sovereign debt crises of recent
years.  However, these are powerful economies, and their government
bonds are used as benchmarks to measure financial risk.
- Index-Linked
Index-Linked gilts were first issued by the UK government in 1981.
The value of the capital you invest, and the level of interest are
adjusted in line with the Retail Price Index (RPI).  Index-Linked gilts
reduce the effect of inflation, but they are not without risks of their
own.  The basic interest rate tends to be less than it is for ëconvention-
alí gilts, which means that overall returns are lower than conventional
gilts if there is little or no inflation.

## 3. Corporate Bonds
Companies have been issuing bonds in Britain for over 200 years.  The
sterling corporate bond market is very active, with a great range of
opportunity.  Companies, however, are not like the government.  Every
one of them is, to some extent, unique, and if they are short of money,
they canít just vote in a tax rise!  Every company, in other words,
carries a different risk.  The degree of risk attributable to any corporate
bond is reflected in its ‘credit rating’.  This is assigned, for a fee, by
rating agencies, the best known of which are Fitch, Moodyís and
## Standard & Poorís.
Because companies are higher risk than the government, they pay
higher interest rates.  Many companies, commonly known as
ëinvestment gradeí, are relatively low risk.  Companies in this category
form the mainstream of the traditional corporate bond market.
Typically, they are large companies with secure long-term profits.
Examples are utilities or businesses in such core sectors as banking,
insurance, telecoms, pharmaceuticals, commercial property, or
resources.
## 4. High Yield Bonds
As the name suggests, high yield bonds pay more than investment
grade bonds.  Against, it is a further step up the risk ladder.  They are
offered by companies with a less certain financial base.  This can be for
many reasons.  It might be a start-up.  It might be a company that
already has substantial debt.  Companies with high investment needs
often turn to high yield.  An example of this would be a cable
television company needing to invest in laying cable in order to deliver
its product.  High yield bonds are mainly issued in US dollars or euros
and therefore may carry an additional currency risk for UK-based
investors (see ëcurrency riskí).
## 5. Emerging Market Debt
Emerging Market Debt is a variation of high yield bonds.  The core of
the market consists of US dollar-denominated bonds issued by
governments in emerging markets, such as India.  These tend to be
less stable than developed economies and, sometimes, dependent on
a narrow range of commodities.  In recent years, as emerging markets
have become a more important part of the global economy, the
market has expanded to include bonds issued in local currencies as
well as in dollars, and bonds issued by companies as well as govern-
ments.
## Equities
Equity means ownership.  Equity in companies is often referred to as
ësharesí because it represents a share of the ownership.  An equity
investor carries the same risk as someone who owns other types of
property.  If you own your house and you sell it, once you have paid
off any charges, such as a mortgage, the proceeds are yours.  On the
other hand, if it burns down, the loss is yours too, or your insurerís.
Equities can deliver substantial rewards.  At the extreme, there are
businesses that start small, but whose technologies lead to positions
of global domination.  More usually, a well-managed company with
strong range of products will be able to sustain profit growth at a
higher rate than other companies, giving investors a superior return
over time.  In practice it is rare for a UK listed company to approach
insolvency, but there are still real risks to investing in equities.
There are two types of return from equities; the share price and the
income companies pay to shareholders, otherwise known as dividends.
Both are products of the company’s profitability and are closely
inter-related, but each has slightly different risks.  The share price is
essentially an estimate of the company’s future profits – and therefore
its ability to pay dividends.  A company with considerable potential to
grow its profits may see its share price rise significantly, even though
its current dividends are low.  Another company may pay high
dividends, but with little prospect of future increases to its profits, with
the result that its share price remains static.  The risk to the former ñ
sometimes called a ‘growth’ share – is that it will be unable to fulfil its
promise to increase profits.  The risk to the latter – sometimes called a
‘value’ share – is that it will be unable to sustain its current profits.
Of the two, growth shares are usually considered higher risk as their
profits are yet to materialise.  They tend to be preferred during periods
of economic strength or by investors seeking long-term returns.
Conversely, value shares, with their more transparent and predictable
business models, will generally be preferred during periods of

economic weakness or by investors to whom present income is more
important than longer term capital gains.  However, while growth
shares are likely to result in a higher overall return in the long term,
value shares can deliver strong compounded returns if dividends are
re-invested rather than withdrawn.
## Large Companies
Large companies tend to be the lowest risk relative to the equity
market as a whole because they have a lot of shareholders, they are
extensively followed and researched, among brokers and investors, in
the media, by competitors, regulators, politicians and private
shareholders.  If anything is going to go wrong, it is likely to be seen
well in advance.  They are likely to have significant financial resources
otherwise they would not be large!  This allows them to sit out difficult
periods.  It also gives them the wherewithal to afford the best advice
and attract the best management.  Large companies are also by
definition more diversified.  Even where a large company operates
within a particular sector, such as energy or retail, it is likely to have
significant built-in diversity, such as operations across different
markets, geographies, product-lines or intellectual properties.  As
significant purchasers, they are also likely to have more influence over
costs and prices.
## Medium-sized Companies
In stock market terms, a medium-sized company is quite large,
covering companies valued from around £500 million to £5 billion.  It
is a higher risk investment than a large company because it will be less
extensively followed, fewer people will be looking at it and its affairs
are unlikely to attract media interest.  Potential upsets are less likely to
be seen and publicised.  A medium-sized company will also typically
have less recourse to loans and other forms of fresh capital.  However,
just as the risks are greater, so are the potential rewards.
## Small Companies
Electronic trading has so enhanced the efficiency of financial markets
that it is now possible for very small companies to list on the stock
exchange.  However, while the smallest public companies may have a
value of as little as £5 to £10 million, it is unusual for a professional
fund manager to invest in companies valued at less than £50 million.
The risks of investing in small and ëmicroí companies is the same as for
medium-sized companies, but more so as you go down the scale.
Small companies are likely to be less diversified and many will be niche
businesses, some with a single product.  They are more likely to face
actual insolvency, while the lack of extensive external research makes it
more likely that mishaps will not be properly forecast or communicat-
ed.  The relative lack of research also means that their shares are likely
to be more vulnerable to mispricing.  Smaller companies are also likely
to have a smaller number of shareholders, which can sometimes make
it more difficult to buy and sell shares and making the market in their
shares potentially more volatile.
## Overseas Equities (aka International Equities)
The risks in investing in overseas equities are different from those
associated with UK equities and usually greater.  The first is that.
listed companies in markets other than the UK keep their accounts,
denominate their shares and pay their dividends in foreign currencies.
A second is that their accounting customs, despite the trend for
international standards, along with legal and regulatory frameworks
and cultural values, are in various degrees different to ours.  It is not
necessarily the case that standards will be lower, but misunderstand-
ings - and therefore mistakes - are more likely to arise in circumstances
which are unfamiliar to us.
## Investment Types (cont.)
## Emerging Markets Equities
A good number of emerging markets seem to have emerged so much
in recent years that they are now world-leading economies.  China is
the prime example, as it is now the worldís second largest economy.
Brazil, India and Russia are gaining in importance, as are Turkey,
Mexico and South Africa.  Emerging markets carry similar risks to all
overseas markets, in terms of currency, accounting, law and culture,
bur more so.  They tend to be less transparent societies, more
vulnerable to political and regulatory risk, including corruption.
Emerging market economies also tend to be particularly narrow, with
only a handful of companies meriting equity investment.  While this
may be increasingly less true of China and even India, it remains the
case with even relatively large markets such as Russia and Brazil. A
further factor with emerging markets is the sheer range of countries in
the category.  At the one end are economies such as the Czech
Republic or Slovenia, which are close to fully developed members of
the European Union, with highly educated workforces and industrial
economies.  Korea is another example of a near-developed economy
which remains classed as emerging.  Others, such as Taiwan and
Mexico, combine highly developed industrial sectors with less
developed regions.  Many, such as Peru or Chile or Indonesia, depend
on one or two commodities.  Others again, such as Egypt or Pakistan,
or a number of African countries, are only just beginning their
integration into the modern world economy.

Appendix IV
- What is portfolio rebalancing?
This is the process of re-establishing your portfolio to its targeted and
originally agreed asset allocation.  This means selling over-weighted
securities in your portfolio to buy under-weighted securities.
- Why should your portfolio be rebalanced?
The investments in your portfolio will perform according to the
market.  As time goes on, your portfolio's asset allocation could move
away from the original and agreed target asset allocation.  If left
unchecked, your portfolio could become either too risky or too
conservative.
- How often should we rebalance your portfolio?
There is no right or wrong answer here. However, we recommend that
portfolios are rebalanced on an annual basis
- When will Verus Wealth rebalance your portfolio?
Unless agreed with you otherwise, we will generally aim to rebalance
your portfolio on an annual basis. We will not rebalance your portfolio
without your prior knowledge.
- Are there other occasions where your portfolio will be rebalanced?
Investment portfolios generally have a minimum of 1% allocated to
cash to meet the ongoing costs and fees. If your portfolio has negative
cash balances, we will notify you either by phone, in writing or by
email.
- What will you receive prior to your portfolio being rebalanced?
Prior to rebalancing your portfolio, we will confirm the:
- Asset allocation compared to the targeted asset allocation; and
ï Recommended transactions in order to re-establish your portfolio to
its targeted and originally agreed asset allocation.
- What happens if we encounter “Open Orders” when rebalancing?
Rebalancing your portfolio to the original portfolio implemented is a
very straight forward process.  However, if your portfolio is being
rebalanced to a new asset allocation or includes different funds etc,
we will wait until the orders (i.e. any pending sales or purchases) are
complete before rebalancing.
Please contact Verus Wealth if you have any questions relating
to rebalancing.
